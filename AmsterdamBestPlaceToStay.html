		<h5>Best Place to Stay in Amsterdam</h5>

		<p>European jewels like Amsterdam often make it tricky to choose the right accommodation, when there is so much to explore everywhere. It gets downright confusing to narrow down between the gorgeous canals, historic sights and museum while choosing where to stay in Amsterdam.
So here is a breakdown of the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Amsterdam, based on tourists’ preferences:
</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	Dam Square</h5>
		<p>Dam Square lies in the heart of City Centre, ringed by canals on all sides. The touristy Royal Palace is closely stationed too, besides popular shopping avenues of Kalverstraat and Nieuwendijk. For cheap thrills, try Waterlooplein’s flea market to shop some antiques and vintage clothes. To the east is the well-known Red Light District. Then there is the Old Church and lively restaurants of Chinatown. Central Station, connected directly to the Amsterdam’s Schipol Airport rests in the north of city centre, a 10 minute walk from Dam Square. Surprisingly, accommodations are darn cheap here, probably due to too much competition.</p>
