      <p>
        From its energy bubbling center to its soulfully beautiful parks, its majestic river to its tall church spires, to be able to define the beauty of Budapest in words is not possible. One of the most exciting cities to be in, there would never be a turn in its road where you won't find a secret hidden complete with the undercover beauty of the history of the place to the old favorite spots to visit. A place that is the living opposite of the word boredom, there are a million ways of exploring the marched and the un-marched territories; one for each visitor.

The focal point of a plethora of terraced cafes, tiny precious parks, and design shops and of course the hidden architectural treasure; there are not many places that can hold a candle to the grace of the beauty, that is, Budapest.
        But what happens when that travel worm inside you starts to crawl; when the boundary of the places come right for your mind and monotony takes root? To help answer the question, here is the list of the best places you can explore beyond the peripheries of Budapest:

Built in the year 1837 in a classical style, the town is made up with twin towers, a wide staircase leading right up to its portico and a plethora of all of the other great views. Among the narrow alleyways of the Old Town you will also come across the Dobo Castle Museum and the Baroque Lyceum. One of the things that you just can’t afford to explore is the medieval Castle of Eger; built in the 11th century it accounts for one of the oldest miracle this place holds.

This district serves the best nightlife in the town, just pull off a stag with your loved ones and start dancing. There are numerous bars and clubs in this area, but what steals the show are the ruin bars, which are something Budapest is known for. Each ruin bar is unique while at the same time, all share certain similarities; the essence of all of them remains usually an abandoned building. There are plenty of ruins bars with different kind of ambience and services, plus you will find a bar at a stone throw distance to another! Cool isn’t it? Something abandoned and dilatated could really be converted into something so lively and fun! So, when in Budapest, try something that its known for its ruin bars. Some of the choices are Szimpla Kert which is one of the first ones, the place is open air and if you are travelling in group with lots of people, this place is highly recommended. Then they have Fogas Haz, which had its opening in 2010. It’s the right choice for you if you are a person who believes in shooting several shots in a single arrow. This place has various arenas including an open air dining and great food, but what stands out is the rock club robot in the basement!
       </p><br>
      <h5>2. Danube river</h5>
      <p>
        Night on a River! Sounds romantic doesn’t it!

Yes, cruise parties on Danube marks the nightlives of Budapest. From Thundering music to wine to food, these cruise parties lure your inner reveler in! The thundering music gets your mind drooling, but no one would mid to take a minute to appreciate those impeccable views of the river and the chain bridge. This place is a live proof that the beauty of Budapest is persistent whether in mornings or at nights!
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Downtown, 15th district</h5>
      <p>
        In the downtown, you can perfectly manage to spend the whole night without going to bed. You can actually checkout as many drinking destinations as you want in one night! To start with it, we recommend you to have dinner in one of the mouthwatering restaurants like Klassz, Gerlóczy or ‘M, ordering the magnificent pálinka, a fruit brandy of Central Europe. After filling your belly, you can wander around the streets from one club to another. In the bars like Boutiq’Bar, Bar Domby or Rézangyal you can dance and listen to music all night, but for a nice talk you might love to go to old pubs like Szimpla, Hivatal or Castro. The fact that this neighborhood has many clubs and bars for drinking makes it all the dreamier for ultimate debauchery. When in Budapest, get ready to open your eyes wide to see what’s going around you. You might enter one and exit another!!!

      <h5>Day 8/Day 9 - Day trip options</h5>
      <p>
        Slovenia, a beautifully tiny country on the south of Central Europa, has of late gained too much paparazzi, thanks to the vibrant capital city of Ljubljana! The greenest city of the continent conjures a personification of eco-travelling, and justifies to the meaning of its name (Ljubljana means Beloved here!). The city is practically bite-sized, with most inhabitants using bicycles as their mode of transportation. As wonderful as it sounds, most of the Central District is now pedestrian. The pristine Ljubljanica River boasts an Amsterdam-ish vibe, with cafes and restros lined on the river bank.
        With so much to unwind, your vacay is bound to fall short of time. However, the periphery of this city is equally alluring. So when on an extended vacation, include the below mentioned best daytrips from Ljubljana:
      </p>
      <h5>1. Zagreb</h5>
      <p>
        Surprisingly, Zagreb hasn’t been featured on as many itineraries as it should, despite the wide popularity of Croatian coasts. Classic Central European grace matched with a bustling city centre make Zagreb a perfect urban outing from Ljubljana. Architectural buffs may begin their sojourn with the Cathedral of Assumption of Holy Virgin Mary and St. Mark’s Church. Then there are some amazing museums, with The Mimara Museum and The Archaeological Museum stealing the show.
        Both buses and trains take 2 and half hours’ time to get you to Zagreb. You can choose drive by yourself and reach in 2 hour’s time.
        </p><br>
      <h5>2. Maribor</h5>
      <p>
        To witness the ‘other’ side of Slovenia, nothing beats the Austria influenced town of Maribor. With a signature, delightfully pleasant Old Town, Maribor lets you unravel prominent tourist spots like The Town Hall, Plaque Memorial, Cathedral on Slomskov Square and Maribor Castle. Visit the Old Vine if you are a wine lover; it’s the oldest vine in the word! In fact, if you are lucky enough to be visiting Maribor in the end of September, get swept away by the Annual Old Vine Festival, a celebration of wine harvest.
        To reach Maribor, catch a train from Ljubljana and get there in 1h 50min. Or you can opt for a bus ride and reach in a little over an hour and a half.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Lake Bled</h5>
      <p>
        Well, if you are nature lover and have got just one day for a day trip from Ljubljana, Lake Bled is your ultimate calling! Seeing postcard pictures of this place is one thing, and witnessing it for real is entirely surreal! A vast water body with forests and snow-capped Julien Mountains in the backdrop give you the most ideal location for a peaceful getaway. Trek along the easy 2 km circuit to gawk at this divine beauty from every possible angle. And of course, there’s a castle here too! Visit the Bled Castle to explore its museum and the epic wine cellar. If you have enough time on your hand, don’t miss out Vintgar Gorge, a natural wonder that lets you hike in rocky paths over wooden bridges along the Radovna River.
        The idea of driving along this gorgeous driveway is the most striking. A car drive will get you there in barely 40 minutes. or you can go for a public transport and reach in about 1h 15min.
        </p><br>
        <h5>4. Piran</h5>
        <p>
          Among all the Istrian coastal towns in Slovenia, Piran tops the charts with its peninsular Venetian look, sweeping sea views and winding alleyways. Starting with Tartinijev Trg, the city’s Old Town actually makes you feel like you are in Italy, since Piran itself was a part of Italy for a long time. Head on to Ulica IX Korpusa as you make your way to the Piran city walls; the place offers some gorgeous panoramas over the Gulf of Trieste. Then spin off towards the Church of St, George and climb up its Bell Tower for even bigger views.
          The quickest way to cover the 121 km distance between Ljubljana and Piran is by car, taking less than an hour and a half to reach. Buses take 2-2.5 hours to get you there, while trains take no less than 3 hours.
        </p><br>
        <h5>5. Lake Bohinj</h5>
        <p>
          Lake Bled is not the only aqua jewel of Slovenia; the land is blessed with another equally gorgeous water wonder, Lake Bohinj. Just 26 km southwest of Bled is this lake, larger in size and fewer in crowds. So if you got no plans to push against tourist hordes at Bled, try this one! Take a walk in the 12 km circuit around the lake, or simply row a boat from the lakeside town of Ribčev Laz.
          Bus rides are the most convenient option and can get you here in less than 2 hours.
        </p><br>
        <h5>6. Postojna Caves</h5>
        <p>
          You may have heard of the science geeks-adored Skojcan Caves. Well, Postojna are for the regular people like us! With over 20 km of karst caves spread underground in Postojna, you are bound to get transported to a mysterious world. Ride in the cave’s electric railway towards the Hall of Great Mountain. The grand geological formations here look like an artificial movie set.
          Many buses leave from Ljubljana for Postojna Caves to get you there in about an hour’s time, 15 minutes more or less depending upon the traffic. You can even choose to drive yourself and reach there in about 40 minutes..

      <p>
        Ljubljana, the Slovenian Capital hosts a wide student population, hence fuelling an eclectic and insane nightlife. Street theatres, Operas, movies and dance clubs flood this beautiful canal-town.

        Stari Trg, or the Old Square, is an interesting locale that yields something worth staying awake for in every 50 yards.

      </p><br>
      <h5>1. Presernov Trg</h5>
      <p>
        To explore the city thoroughly, the place to stay in Ljubljana is Presernov Square. This gorgeous medieval square is perfectly stationed between the Old Town and Central District, two mostly touristy spots of Ljubljana. Boulevards frilled with grotesque buildings have many cultural and sightseeing offerings. You can identify the area with the Preseren Monument, a statue right in its heart. The small, but much acclaimed Triple Bridge lies to its southern edge. The area is exclusive to pedestrians and cyclists, making the whole atmosphere serene.

      <h5>2. Tivoli City Park</h5>
      <p>
        Tivoli Park is the largest park in Ljubljana, located on the northern edge of the City Center. For centuries, it has been the place for recreation for the locals, and continues to be so. It is beautifully placed amidst the rolling hills and boasts a perfect picnic spot with pastures, wooden placements and adventure playgrounds. There are a bunch of tourist spots in the area like the International Centre for Graphic Arts, Museum of Modern History and a zoo. Safety is never a problem in Ljubljana. Travelers who have been to this city earlier and are done with all the main attractions choose this locality for a perfect, laid-back vacation.
