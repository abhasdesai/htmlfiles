		<h5>Best Day trips from Athens</h5>

		<p>Athens, the capital city of Greece and also the largest, dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest establishments, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years! Its earliest human presence started somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennium BC; almost when we began to turn from apes to humans! The leftover footmarks of the classical era are still prevalent in many parts of the city, represented by ancient monuments and works of art. The most famous is the Parthenon, considered a major landmark of early Western civilization. Besides, Athens also has its Roman and Byzantine monuments intact, as well as a smaller number of Ottoman monuments.
As breathtaking as its heritage might be, there is no harm planning a few day-tours from Athens. Here are our recommendations for the best day trips from Athens:

<h5>1.	Cape Sounion and the Temple of Poseidon</h5>
<p>
  The Temple of Poseidon at Sounion is the best day trip you can do out of Athens. The temple has Doric style columns and was built in the 5th Century BC. It is supposedly erected on the location of an older temple. You are not allowed to enter the temple anymore because it is roped off. However, you can get close enough to appreciate it and be awestruck. If conscious enough, one might even read the symbols carved on the ancient columns, some of which are known to be even hundreds of years old. Below the temple you will find a small bay with the Aegeon Beach Hotel which is as close as you can get to being on a Greek island this near to Athens without really being on a Greek island. During the summer months, you can swim in the crystal clear waters of a nearby beach and have some fresh seafood in a seafront tavern. Don’t forget to admire one of the most magnificent sunsets when in town.
Catch the bus, or opt for private taxis. Approx travel time for any transportation is 1 hour 20 minutes.

<h5>2.	Delphi</h5>
<p>
  Delphi occupies an impressive and strategic site on the south-western edge of Mount Parnassus, overlooking the beautiful coastal plain to the south and the Phocis valley. Now a fascinating archaeological site with a modern town of the same name quite near to it, on your day trip to Delphi, do not miss the chance to visit the Temple of Apollo, the ancient theatre and the archaeological museum. In the inner hearth of the Temple of Apollo, an eternal flame burns. On your way, you can also stop by the nearby village of Arachova, which happens to be a very popular winter resort. A lucrative opportunity to delve in the realms of ancient history and glory, Delphi is not the day tour you would want to miss at all.

<h5>3.	Mycenae, Epidaurus and Nafplio</h5>
