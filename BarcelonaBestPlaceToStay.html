		<h5>Best Place to Stay in Barcelona</h5>

		<p>
      Lively and colorful Barcelona faces the Mediterranean Sea and features the world's top city beaches, including Sant Sebastià, Barceloneta and Somorrostro beaches. The city sets the template for urban style, hip design and sheer nonstop energy. 
The city’s popularity means finding a hotel vacancy at any time of year can be difficult, so it’s always best to book in advance. There’s a wide range of options, though, from youth hostels and budget pensions to glam five-star-plus hotels, housed in medieval mansions and Modernist masterpieces alike.

		<h5>1.	Gothic Quarter</h5>
		<p>Gothic Quarter is the most central area of Barcelona and very well connected to everything. It is one of the city’s most touristic areas. There are world-class shops and museums only steps away. Food wise, it’s not the best neighborhood but there are some diamonds in the rough. The main avenue of the Gothic Quarter is called Les Rambles (Las Ramblas), and it’s surrounded by luxury hotels and hostels alike. Honestly, I wouldn’t skimp if deciding to stay in this part of town. You’ll get what you pay for. If trying to save, you might consider a guest apartment, which is a great choice when traveling as a family! </p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>2.	El Born</h5>
		<p>El Born is perfect for anyone looking to be in the heart of Barcelona, the beach, the Gothic Quarter and Several metro stops that connect you to rest of the major stops. This neighborhood is perfect for exploring little local shops full of amazing products from handmade ceramics to custom leather aprons (which every trendy restaurant seems to have their waiters wear!) to art galleries. The alleyways are filled with street art, especially la bomba (the bomb), which represents Barcelona’s anarchist spirit, and flags and buntings for the perfect photo opportunities.</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>3.	Barcelenota</h5>
		<p>The most preferred neighborhood for beach lovers, but suffers with the utmost backlash for tourism by the locals. Nevertheless, you can stay here if you respect the locals. That means that when you leave the beach put on some clothes before you pop into a shop or grabs a bite to eat. If you are out until the early hours of the morning (which happens easily here), keep your voices down to avoid disturbing people who are asleep. Take a stroll along the sand and notice all the locals out walking, rollerblading, biking, and soaking up the Mediterranean sun. Barceloneta will treat you well if you treat it well.</p>
