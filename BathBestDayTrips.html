However, the trip of England can't be just limited to the boundaries of Bath. Here is an index to some of the best day trips you can plan from Bath:

<h5>1.	Bristol</h5>
<p>
	If we have to find a city in Britain on the rise as of the present time, Bristol would be perfect for the title. Though initially Bristol was a heavy industry place, the recent years have seen development as the city has reinvented itself, earning the title of the hub of creativity and culture. Renowned for its offbeat character, you will find a profusion of art collectives, cafes run by the community and music venues sprinkled evenly around the city. Some of the major sights in the city involve SS Great Britain, Kenner and Avon Canal, Clifton Suspension Bridge, Bristol Zoo and the M shed. Located at a meagre distance of 20 km, the most time efficient option is the rails, taking hardly 15 minutes of average travel time. Other options include buses taking 45mins and cars taking about half an hour.
