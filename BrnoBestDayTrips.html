		<h5>Best Day trips from Brno</h5>

		<p>Brno, a ghastly understated capital city in Czech Republic, has for many years had a dull rep, thanks to the popular local movie ‘Boredom in Brno’. However, with tens of thousands of students reappraising the city’s image with vibrant club scenes and lively cafes, Brno can easily rival Prague in terms of offerings. Known for its modernist buildings, we bet the travelers haven’t seen an atmosphere as authentic and lively as Brno’s. Surprisingly, the Moravian capital has yet to be discovered by mass tourism, meaning that prices and crowds are both minimal and manageable.
So as you traverse through Brno, spare a day or two for these equally charming day tours that can be taken from this city. Check out these best day trips from Brno to know more:

<h5>1.	Moravian Karst and Caves</h5>
<p>
  The Moravian Karst is an eminent landscape reserve to the north of Brno. Located by the eastern part of the Czech Republic, the town of Blansko is stationed close to the main city. Refreshing air and stunning caverns that make this place famous, make it to the top position of the day trips when in Brno. The Karst area is spread throughout a stretch of 100 square kilometers and has multitudes of caves and gorges, four of which are open to the public for self-guided tours. For ones with an adventurous streak, a number of less-traveled caverns can be visited with a qualified guide. You’d be at a great loss on missing the boat tour along an underground river. The Macocha Abyss is also of good importance with numerous excellent walking trails.
Located at an easy 30-minute distance from Brno, the most convenient mode of travel is by train.
