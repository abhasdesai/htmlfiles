		<h5>1.	Historic Center</h5>
		<p>Both the quality and quantity of pubs and bars in the main piazza of Bruges is paramount. A confusing maze of narrow alleys frilled with authentic pubs is the perfect explanation of this nightlife district in Bruges. Locals and tourists flock to the area to sedate with one of the many Belgian Beers. Go Kemelstraat for an almost-ancient pub experience, or hit the streets of Vlamingstraat and Blekerstraat to choose from the umpteen options. ‘t Poatersgat, unarguably the most famous pub in Bruges, is a must-go while you are here. Hidden in historical building’s basement, this candlelit pub offers comfortable sitting, great music and countless beers. Comptoir Des Arts is another popular basement pub known for its wide selection of whiskeys and beers.

<h5>2.	‘t Zand</h5>
		<p>Mostly known for its large venues offering impeccable Live Music, ‘t Zand is the largest public square in Bruges. Its eminent open-air concert site is the ideal setting to host music shows as well as antique markets. Moreover, it is one of the best places to party in the city. Cactus Festival, an awaited Summer treat, fills the plaza for 3 days with tunes from all over the world. After the concert goers are done with the screaming and head-banging, they flock to more comfortable aftershow palavers like James Pub. Café ‘t Zand is a world-famous eateries serving great food and countless beers. De Zandloper Taphouse is another very popular hideout for beerlicious travelers.</p>

<h5>3.	Sint-Anna Quarter</h5>
		<p>Elegant, baroque interiors and the famous Sint-Anna Church make this quarter quite sought-after. The neighborhood is mostly inhabited by blue-collar workers and is a tranquil place to be. However, Langestraat, a well-known street that runs like an artery from this otherwise serene district is a buzzing lane fringed with cozy restaurants and candlelit Tapas Bars. This beautiful district, much away from the crowds, suits the ‘suffer in silence’ drinkers and partiers. Bistro Sint Anna is a great hashery for travelers seeking some local experience.
