	<h5>Best Day trips from Brussles</h5>


	<p>Playing capital to Belgium and the Brussels Capital Region, Brussels stands out as a historic yet hip, bureaucratic yet bizarre, haughty yet humble town with a blend of cultures to its very roots. Profuse with bustling outdoor markets, a stunning royal palace and more than a dozen fantastic museums setting the scene, with a variety of breweries and shops to ensure nonstop enjoyment, Brussels itself is a place demanding ample time for exploration. However, the trip to the place isn't complete without soaking up the culture present in the vicinity.To witness the greatest confluence of culture and nature in the world, here are some of the best one day trips from Brussels that will let you delve into this beautiful side of Europe:
</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
	<h5>1.	Bruges</h5>
	<p>A portal to the past taking you directly into the bustling street of the civil life of the yester years, Bruges lies at a distance of barely 100kms from Brussels. Largely a pedestrian city, the best way to explore the city is to take a reece on foot. A traditionally fairy-tale medieval town, abounding with picturesque cobbled lanes and dreamy canals linking photogenic market squares lined with soaring towers, historic churches and old whitewashed almshouses, this is one of the most rushed place in the list, flooding with tourists especially in summer.One of the easiest and time saving options to choose would be taking the rail costing you slightly over an hour. Another alternative is to take a bus that takes around 1 hourand  20 minutes, or driving for the same while.
</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
	<h5>2.	Ghent</h5>
	<p>One of Europe's greatest discovery and the one of Belgium's best kept secret, Ghent is one city drawing unanimous love. The confluence of medieval frivolity sufficient to create a spectacle and gritty industrial edge that keeps things ‘real’, Ghent is small enough to feel cosy and big enough to stay vibrant. Brimming with fabulous canalside architecture, wealth of quirky bars and some of Belgium’s most fascinating museums with a low tourism makes Ghent a must visit in the list.To cover the distance of 40kms, there are three ways, picking the train, rushing you to the place in half an hour. Other ways include hiring a taxi or driving all the way both taking a duration of one hour.

<div class="container content-wrapper">
	<h5>3.	Luxembourg City</h5>
	<p>Often mistaken for just a destination of banks and EU offices, Luxembourg City is often ticked off the list for its commercial character. However, reality that hits you after entering the place is entirely converse. A city full of weird spaces, tunnels, and surprising nooks to explore, along with splendid museums and a great dining scene, Luxembourg is one of Europe's most scenic capitals. The best time to visit the place is during a weekend with the on-street parking free and the prices of food taking a lunge.Lying at a distance of approximately 320kms, complete with beautifully built roads and unparalleled scenery along the way the best way to travel is to drive the way. Other than that, buses and trains frequent every hour from Brussels to Luxembourg.

<div class="container content-wrapper">
	<h5>4.	Dinant</h5>
		<p>To the southwest corner of Belgium lies this French speaking region of Wallonia called Dinant. Perched on the banks of River Meusse, with the Citadel of Dinant as the main attraction, the city offers sweeping vistas from atop its cliff, rising arrogantly over the river and the gorgeous city landscapes. To reach up to the Citadel, wear your best shoes, or simply take the cable car if trekking iis not your dope. You can reach Dinant by Euro Rail, or hire a bus. Driving your way through is another viable option, that takes about 1 hour 10 minutes to reach.
</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
	<h5>5.	Maastricht</h5>
		<p>Considered a true melting pot, in lieu of its location at a distance of just a few miles from Germany and Belgium, Maastricht is one of the most beautiful in the list. Another one of the culturally rich burghals, replete with Spanish and Roman ruins, sophisticated food and drink, French and Belgian twists in the architecture, a shrugging off of the shackles of Dutch restraint, Maastricht is a lively and energetic place, with appeal and allure out of proportion to its size. While strolling around the city, some of the must visit places include: The Markt and the Vrijthof. Another major attraction in the place is the Saint Pietersberg Caves. Again, with three ways of commutation, there is the option of train taking around 3 hours. Other ways include driving or taking a bus covering the same in 3hr 30minutes.
