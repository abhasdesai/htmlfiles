		<h5>1.	Manneken Pis</h5>
		<p>‘Little Man Pee is a legendary bronze statuette, one of the many fountains in Brussels. During festivities, this naked little boy peeing in the fountain is dressed in vibrant attires.

<h5>2.	Place de St. Gery</h5>
		<p>The Place Saint Grey is an old, historic square that serves as a superb nightlife space for punters and partiers. Hardly a 5 minute walk from La Bourse, the piazza serves s an ideal place to relax, meet your friends over lunch on a terrace, watch posers kissing in the air while seeing the sun set. Then after dark, it turns the volume and heat on for night owls seeking some debauchery and hedonism. Joints like Mapa Mundi, Zebra, Le Roi des Belge to name a few, are great places to grab a beer and engage in small talk with locals and tourists.</p>
