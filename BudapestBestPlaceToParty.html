		<h5>1.	7th district</h5>
		<p>Sun setting gorgeously over the Danube River in the background, with Ruin bars and pubs taking the center stage, just name it and 7th district has it! This district serves the best nightlife in the town, just pull off a stag with your loved ones and start dancing. There are numerous bars and clubs in this area, but what steals the show are the ruin bars, which are something Budapest is known for. Each ruin bar is unique while at the same time, all share certain similarities; the essence of all of them remains usually an abandoned building. There are plenty of ruins bars with different kind of ambience and services, plus you will find a bar at a stone throw distance to another! Cool isn’t it? Something abandoned and dilatated could really be converted into something so lively and fun! So, when in Budapest, try something that its known for its ruin bars. Some of the choices are Szimpla Kert which is one of the first ones, the place is open air and if you are travelling in group with lots of people, this place is highly recommended. Then they have Fogas Haz, which had its opening in 2010. It’s the right choice for you if you are a person who believes in shooting several shots in a single arrow. This place has various arenas including an open air dining and great food, but what stands out is the rock club robot in the basement!

<h5>3.	Downtown, 15th district</h5>
		<p>In the downtown, you can perfectly manage to spend the whole night without going to bed. You can actually checkout as many drinking destinations as you want in one night! To start with it, we recommend you to have dinner in one of the mouthwatering restaurants like Klassz, Gerlóczy or ‘M, ordering the magnificent pálinka, a fruit brandy of Central Europe. After filling your belly, you can wander around the streets from one club to another. In the bars like Boutiq’Bar, Bar Domby or Rézangyal you can dance and listen to music all night, but for a nice talk you might love to go to old pubs like Szimpla, Hivatal or Castro. The fact that this neighborhood has many clubs and bars for drinking makes it all the dreamier for ultimate debauchery. When in Budapest, get ready to open your eyes wide to see what’s going around you. You might enter one and exit another!!!
