		<h5>Top Attractions in Constanta</h5>
<p>
  Situated at the crossroads of several commercial routes, Constanta is Romania's oldest and main Black Sea port and one of the major commercial hubs in the region.  The city is worth exploring for its archaeological treasures, beach resorts, open-air restaurants, historical monuments, ancient ruins and the atmosphere of the old town center. Constanta is more than just an entry point to the Black Sea coast. It is a beautiful city with a long and interesting past, attested by its various Roman vestiges, historic buildings, ancient ruins and mosques that grace the Old City Center also boasting about its traditional villages, vineyards, and Danube Delta.

<h5>Casino Constanta:</h5><p> Located at 2 Elisabeta Boulevard along the Black Sea, Casino Constanta is a historic monument built in Art Nouveau style between 1904 and 1910 according to the plans of Daniel Renard. It is a prime example of the faded city splendor and is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs. This casino once hosted glamorous royal parties, but now sits completely abandoned. Though you cannot play, you must definitely visit it for its beguiling architectural details.</p>
