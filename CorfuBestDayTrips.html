		<h5>Best Day trips from Corfu</h5>

		<p>No other Mediterranean destination has managed to encompass a history so rich, and a land so beautiful as this one! Corfu, a much frequented Greek island in the Ionian Sea, is the second largest of the Islands and forms a major chunk of territorial Greece. Bound up with the legends of Greece from the beginnings of Greek mythology, with the fables and stories being loaded in innumerous battles and conquests, Corfu often manages to overtake Santorini and Mykonos in terms of popularity. St George South to the west boasts the largest sandy beach on the island, coupled with a selection of all inclusive package hotels and traditional villas and flats. Its picturesque Korission Lake Nature Reserve is a haven for bird watchers and photographers.
Apparently, the neighboring area of Corfu demand equal attention with respect to things to see and do. So here are our top picks for the best day trips from Corfu:

<h5>1.	Paleokastritsa</h5>
<p>
  Paleokastritsa, a village in northwestern Corfu, is unarguably one of the most beautiful villages in all of Greece. Surrounded by loads of cypress trees, it is set around three bays and boasts of more than twelve amazing beaches. Paleokastritsa is located about 25 kilometers from the airport and Corfu Town. Water taxis are available to visit other bays near this picturesque village. On the northern edge of Paleokastritsa is the monastery of Theotokos, made in the 12th-century. The monastery is notable for its ceiling carving of the Tree of Life, as well as its museum showcasing its holy relics. The nearby villages of Lakones and Krinic can easily be covered along with Paleokastritsaon your day tour.
40 minutes away from central city, you can get here by bus and taxis. Self drive is always an option for thrillers and free wanderers.

<h5>2.	Diapontian Islands</h5>
<p>
  Diapontian islands are a Greek island complex in the Ionian Sea. Perched on the northwest edge of Corfu, the only inhabited islands of the archipelago are Othonoi, Ereikoussa and Mathraki that qualify to be the most tranquil and serene places for a holiday. Be sure to not miss a sunset when there. The day tour doesnâ€™t demand much from you; simply lie down by the water and breathe in the beauty of the place. Be sure not to miss the sunset when there. Other than that, you can delve into recreational sports or just have a nice walk in the evening.
In order to get to this magical complex of islands, the shortest and easiest way is to take the boat departing from the small port of Agios Stefanos.

<h5>3.	Saranda</h5>
		<p>Saranda, a commendable port perched on the southern shores of Albania, is an easy and worthwhile day trip from corfu. Scattered islands and virgin shores make Saranda equally explorable as its nearby picturesque villages. The greatest highlight of your day tour would be an excursion to Butrint, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a remarkable ancient town that has disappeared under thick layers of silt and vegetation. So get set to be teleported to 3rd Century A.D, a time when the ancient temple. The Roman ablutions and the Ancient Gymnasium were active and working!
Ferries are the only mode of commutation between Corfu and Saranda (unless you are filthy rich; then you can consider a private Yacht!). Faster ferries get you there in 30-45 minutes, while the slower ones taking a maximum of 1.5 hours.

<h5>4.	Paxoi and Antipaxoi</h5>
		<p>Paxoi and Antipaxoi are small islands stationed in close proximity to Cofru. Featuring a tantalizing mix of superb beaches, turquoise waters, walking trails, sleepy villages, buzzing towns, delicious food, excellent water sports and plenty of history, Paxoi and Antipaxoi actually demand more than just a day to be inraveled. Needless to say, these places do not conform entirely to our mental image of a stereotypical whitewashed Greek archipelago. Covered by rich vegetation ( mainly olive trees), these small islands will fascinate you with their breathtaking beaches, beautiful landscapes and the friendly small taverns.
Situated ten miles south of Corfu, Paxoi and Antipaxoi are easily accessible via boats. During the summer months, boats depart daily for these cute little atolls from the central port of Corfu.
