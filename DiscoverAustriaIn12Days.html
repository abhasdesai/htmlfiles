      <h5>Day 8/Day 9 – Day trip options</h5>
      <h5>Best one day trips from Salzburg</h5><br>
      <p>
        A city equally admired for its architecture as it is for its magnificent natural setting, Salzburg also enjoys a special fame in the world of music as the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Stand along the rapid Slzach River and you will spend hours gawking at the domes and spires, the formidable fortress and mountains far and beyond. Besides being with a beautiful historic city itself, Salzburg makes a wonderful base for day trips into the equally picturesque surrounding countryside of Austria. Blessed with an excellent rail network, the city is also an excellent post to explore other Austrian cities like Vienna and Innsbruck.
      </p><br>
      <p>Catering to a wide stratum of tourists, some of the best options for a one-day trip from Salzburg include the following:</p>
      <h5>1. Berchtesgaden</h5>
      <p>
        Located on the tip of the German border, Berchtesgaden is a charming, postcard-perfect town with infinite beauty in its own right, and a backdrop made up of stunning mountain peaks and salt mines. One of the greatest attractions in the town is the Eagle's Nest, giving you a spectacular view of the alluring valley pinpointed by lavish villas. Remaining as a poignant reminder of the past, the town of Berchtesgaden sits on one of the most spectacular natural settings in the world. Featuring narrow, winding streets that are lined with pastel houses in the alpine style, and locals entertaining the visitors with Bavarian music and dance, this is one place you just can't get bored in.
Located at a distance of 40kms, the distance is covered in 45 minutes by a bus, 30 minutes by a taxi and an hour and a half by a train ride.
        </p><br>
      <h5>2. Hallstatt</h5>
      <p>
        Overlooking the crystal blue waters of Lake Hallstatt, the tiny community of Hallstatt is perhaps the most beautiful example of the many quaint traditional villages waiting to be explored in Upper Austria. With history dating back to more than 4000 years, the town today caters to the tourists with picturesque views and the charming town itself. With a total car ban observed during summers, the place is a pedestrian-friendly spot. Indulge in the gorgeous views with a steaming cup of cocoa in your hand from a local cafe, in a town plays the perfect place to sit down and relax.
Although not the fastest way to travel, trains are still preferred by many for the simple and less stressful way taking around 2hr 15min. Other options include taking a bus taking 2hr 45min while cabs and cars taking one and a half hour.
        </p><br>
      <h5>3. Vorarlberg</h5>
      <p>
        Vorarlberg is the western most federal state of Austria having Bregenz as the capital city. Although is the second smallest area, it has the second highest population density. Vorarlberg is also distinct in that it is the only state in Austria where the local dialect is not Austro Bavarian, but rather an Alemmanic dialect; it therefore has much more in common culturally with its Alemannic-speaking neighbours Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Swabia than with Bavaria and the rest of Austria. You can travel to Vorarlberg from Salzburg by train or by drive. Train rides are available every 4 hours of the day. Both options take 3 hours and 30 minutes to complete.
        </p><br>

    <div class="container content-wrapper">
      <h5>Best places to party in Salzburg</h5><br>
      <p>
        Salzburg may not be geographically mondo, but its ‘University Town’ characteristic coupled with its musical and cultural excellence makes the city a decent venue for night owls. Irish pubs and inns, live music venues and small, cozy bars may not qualify as “exciting” according to the international clubbing standards, but Salzburg serves well to the low-key, easy-going clientele.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        So check out the top 3 place to party in Salzburg:
      </p>
      <h5>1. Alstadt</h5>
      <p>
        Alstadt, a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site, is a gorgeous ensemble of medieval spires and fairy-tale like aura. Despite the stringent rules in this area (so as to save the ancient-ness), Altstadt accommodates a peppy nightlife in Salzburg. Besides being a hub for daytime sightseeing and shopping, Altstadt offers the best nightlife in Salzburg. Talk about laid-back pubs and bars, or minutely-pretentious nightclubs and discos, everything rests here. Café Altstadt in Radisson Blu is fairly eye-catching for people seeking a sophisticated space over food and drinks.
        </p><br>
      <h5>2. Rudolfskai</h5>
      <p>
        Go left of the Salzach River and you land up in Rudolfskai, Salzburg’s top party mile exhibiting some well preserves parts of the city walls. This heavily fortified face of Salzburg now has most of its monuments between Staatsbrucke and Mozartsteg converted into Irish pubs and swanky bars. On weekends, it is the most favored spot for youths to gt high and wasted. Nightclubs in Rudolfskai are generally loud and noisy in character. Try the Shamrock Irish pub for good booze.
