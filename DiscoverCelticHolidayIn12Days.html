      <h5>Day 2/Day 3 – Day trip options</h5>
      <h5>1.  Giant's Causeway</h5>
      <p>
        One of the best geological marvels, Giant Causeway, has been referred as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and portrays the capital’s conflicted history wrapped in the arms of heritage. Located on the North-east of the County Antrim in Belfast, this place is well steeped in legends and myths. To reach the cliff top here, you can take one of the four trails that lead you to stunning vistas and magnificent seascapes from up there. Another attraction on the trip would be the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge, a connecting bridge between the mainland and the tiny island of Carrickarede. Replete with aesthetic headlands famous for shooting of Game of Thrones, this is one place you just can't check out of your list. So for people who are easily charmed by geological antiquities, rugged cliffs and secluded bays, Giant Causeway renders the perfect heaven!
        You can take one of the many trains that take 2 hours to get you from Dublin to Belfast. Even a road trip would be ideal if you wish to enjoy Irish beauty at its best. From there, it is another hour’s drive to Giant Causeway.
      </p><br>
      <h5>2.  Cliffs of Moher</h5>
      <p>
        To escape the bustle of the cosmopolitan life-style, this is the perfect day-out trip from Dublin. Cliffs of Moher are a premier tourist spot, just south to the village of Doolin. Once there, you can simply spend your day strolling on rugged coastal paths offering you insight into the geology and history of the beautiful area from your guide while spending time in the exquisite Burren National Park. On a clear, sunny day, you can gawk at the Aran Islands in Galway Bay and Valleys of Connemara from afar.
        As you catch the train from Dublin to Doolin, you get to admire the unparalleled beauty of the countryside containing the dramatic array of cliffs. However, it is better to hit the road to save time; you will reach the village in about 3 hours.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3.  Blarney Castle</h5>
      <p>
        One of the best ways to enhance your trip to Ireland is with a full-day excursion trip to the three of country's top attractions. Visit the Blarney Castle and tick kissing the famous ‘Blarney Stone of Eloquence’ off your bucket list. Besides that, the maze of underground passages and chambers are a challenge even to the most intrepid explorers. Rock Close is another enchanted place in the castle, full of surprises at every turn. You can spend time exploring the Cork city from the recommendations of your local guide. If your stamina is strong and your shoes are right, this might turn into one of the best trips of your life.
        To get to Cork from Dublin, take up an early morning train to reach the destination on time. It takes you roughly 2-3 hours to reach, depending upon the train that you choose.
      </p><br>
      <h5>4.  Wild Wicklow</h5>
      <p>
        To get an insight into the mystical and majestic side of Ireland, Wicklow County is the place to be. It is an unarguably unparalleled countryside, abounding with forests, rugged hills and an extra dose of greenery. You can board the ride taking you to the magical land full of cultural and natural gems and lively pubs. The perfect romantic setting, this is one of the places you can often see on the big screens including the rom-coms like Braveheart and P.S. I love you. You can also experience the love in the 'Garden of Ireland'.
        Since it is located on the southern edge of Dublin, you can reach the spot in no time. Just catch one of the public buses in the morning and make the most of your vacay.

      <p>
        The South Bank of river Liffey holds maximum action of the 24/7 party city of Dublin. Temple Bar Area guarantees a weekend overflowing with booze, party and music.

On Sunday evenings, locals and travelers flock to The Foggy Dew, an authentic bar with a great blend of punters. And if you are seeking more style and sophistication, try The Morgan.
        </p><br>
      <h5>2. O’Connell Street Area</h5>
      <p>
        Located in the heart of the city, O’Connell Street is the most monumental of all the commercial streets in Dublin. This large boulevard is unavoidable with such amazing shopping avenues and hotels. Murray’s, the traditional Irish pub, offers impeccable Irish booze coupled with live music and Irish dances every week, where audiences are welcomed to join in. T.P. Smiths Bar is another great hideaway offering both large and intimate spaces to enjoy a few drinks with your friends.

        </p><br>
      <h5>3. Camden Street</h5>

This 17th century pub was as frequented by literary giants as by regular drinkers. Devitt’s Pub is another great escape for people looking for a Hen Party venue. But very few know of Anseo, a hidden gem surrounded by the Village Quarter, giving it a character offbeat to the Temple Bar Area. Music swings from Afro-beats to Groove, giving some serious adrenaline issues to the laid back visitors.

      <h4>Best places to stay in Dublin</h4>
      <p>
        Despite being the commercial and cosmopolitan Irish capital, Dublin gives you a compact, country-like feel. The overly hospitable locals and various price-bracketed options ranging from chic hotels to city-centre apartments make the entire city a perfect base for vacationers.
        So if you are travelling across Ireland and seeking a perfect stay in the 1,000 year old Dublin city, try searching among our insider’s guide to top 3 places for accommodations for a tourist in Dublin:
      </p><br>
      <h5>1. City Centre North</h5>
      <p>

General Post Office is one of the many Dublin’s luminaries. Cafes, restaurants and bars line the streets in this locality, besides an impeccable public transport system to connect you to Dublin’s neighborhoods.

      </p><br>
      <h5>2. St. Stephen’s Green</h5>
      <p>
        This lush green locality lies to the South of Trinity College and is linked to it by Grafton Street.

The leafy waterfront walks of Grand canal, just west to St. Stephen’s Green are a perfect haven for locals after work. Travelers also fancy Portobello’s well-maintained Victorian-styled, red-brick terraces. As you move further south, the splendid suburbs of Ballsbridge offer many upscale restros and hotels for tourists.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Dun Laoghaire</h5>
      <p>
        Seven miles south of Dublin city is this charming coastal neighborhood of Dublin, a mere 20-minute ride from the City centre. The two huge piers are the most loved promenading points here. Spectacular rolling hills surround this beautiful neighborhood, making it ideal for peace seekers and nature lovers. Going further south, you reach Sandycove, a cozy bathing spot flocked by locals and travelers alike. The centuries-old Martello Tower houses the famous James Joyce Museum. Fishing is a popular activity here; you can rent rods and boats from one of the many operators at harbor.

        <h4>Best places to party in Edinburgh</h4>
        <p>
          The student-packed capital of Scotland has a host of districts to let you have the wildest of night outs. Nightlife in Edinburgh is at the heart of world culture, especially with the flurry of festivals that go on and on here! Bars and Pubs line almost every street here, offering you every experience from traditional taverns to upbeat stylish bars.
          To take a better look at the swanky night scene that fills this picturesque town, visit the top 3 places to party in Edinburgh:
        </p><br>
        <h5>1. Old Town</h5>
        <p>
          Circumscribing the student-dominate area of Cowgate is the most historic neighborhood of Edinburgh, the Old Town. The winding Royal Mile of this district is replete with bars, pubs and nightclubs. The ones on Grassmarket, Victoria Street and Candlemaker Road are popular for a reliably raucous vibe, offering a number of live music joints and cheap drinks. Most of the adjoining small alleys and walkways render folk music experiences. Visit Bow Bar if you are a ‘suffer in silence’ type, or Whistle Binkies if throwing shapes on the dance floor is your idea. For party throwers, there is Electric Circus hosting impeccable hen parties. And the ones looking for cheap thrills in loud and sweaty clubs, The Hive offers a labyrinth dance floor.
          </p><br>
        <h5>2. Leith</h5>
        <p>
          The Port of Leith, city’s major harbor is often in news for its eclectic pub culture and sumptuous seafood. It is a gentrified area now, with huge investments making it a up-and-coming district right by the docks. Old Chain Pier, a delightful bar overlooking the sea renders original ales, bottled Craft Beer and cocktails. A personally favored pub right in the heart of Leith is Nobles, a gorgeously restored Victorian-era styled café-bar. Then there is The Village, a vibrant bar with locals playing folk gigs in the back room. Bar hopping is up the charts in Leith, with Swedish-owned joints pulling maximum crowds.
          </p><br>
        <h5>3. George Street</h5>
        <p>
          George Street is an opulent district that lets big pocket-sizes have endless fun. It runs parallel to the Princes Street and is often overlooked by travelers who are focused to reach the Old Town. Beautiful historic mansions with stunning interiors have undergone a facelift with a bar tag on them. Tigerlily offers a great atmosphere with comfortable seating and delicious food, albeit it is said to cater to the richer University students only. Opal, Lulu, Why Not? and Shanghai are the four most crowded venues in the area. Hard Rock Café, a golden oldie hosts a lot of locals and students too.

        <h4>Best places to stay in Edinburgh</h4>
        <p>
          The cobbled streets and Gothic architecture of this historical capital of Scotland now stand in contrast to its Jekyll and Hyde character. Edinburgh is a delectable year-round destination that offers a complete package to travelers. There is so much beauty in and around the city; shoppers can shop, partiers can party and others can simply relax by the lochs.
          So depending upon your purpose of travel, base yourself in the most appropriate district here. Check out the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Edinburgh:
        </p><br>
        <h5>1. Old Town</h5>
        <p>
          This is where Edinburgh began. Home to the Edinburgh University and its thousands of students, Old Town offers you immaculate medieval alleys, grand squares and the famous landmarks of Edinburgh Castle, Royal Museum of Scotland and St. Giles’ Cathedral. Major parks like Princes Street Gardens, The Meadows and Holyrood bedeck the grey architecture. A large variety of restaurants, pubs and shopping avenues line the main street of Old Town. Visit the unavoidable Arthur’s Seat and Crags nestled in the Holyrood Park that make you feel like you’ve come to a countryside walk. For travelers, accommodations in Old Town range from classy upscale brands to arty boutique hotels, suiting all pocket-sizes.
        </p><br>
        <h5>2. New Town</h5>
        <p>
          Neo-classical buildings, elegant squares and an appreciable town planning, New Town maintains its authenticity with the streets names after kings and queens. This district of Edinburgh is the most expensive one, with Multrees Walk boasting city’s top designer stores. For punters, there’s George Street, housing the most extravagant nightlife of Edinburgh. For those seeking cheap thrills, there are Rose and Thistle Roads offering excellent bets in economical eateries, pubs and shops. Broughton, the eastern end of New Town is a thriving Gay Quarter with a bohemian feel.
        </p><br>
        <h5>3. Stockbridge</h5>
        <p>
          Stockbridge is the most appealing neighborhood of Edinburgh having a country-like vibe to it. Situated by the New Town and Comely Bank is this compact zone that is home to quirky shops displaying artisans and local designers. Waters of Leith run across Stockbridge, leaving an enticing Walkway to be strolled through. Plan a picnic at the Royal Botanical Gardens or hit the Brandon Street for a nice coffee. This area is a rather quiet alternative to the bustling New and Old town, sans the loud nightclubs or bustling shopping streets. But you can always hit the George Street, a 10 minute walk from here.

  <h5>Day 13 – Day trip options</h5>
  <h5>1.  Blue Lagoon</h5>
  <p>
    The most natural and rejuvenating natural spa, Blue Lagoon is the world’s greatest geothermal seawater, known for its skin enrichment effects. Located in a small town of Grindavik, stationed close to Reykjavik, Blue Lagoon lets you soak in splendid vistas of nature as you dip yourself in the energizing silica mud. So lose yourself in the geothermal waters, followed by a nice cold water shower and then an exhilarating neck and shoulder massage under the waterfall! This place is the best pick to give your vacay a relaxing end.
    Many buses commute between Reykjavik and Blue Lagoon at regular intervals. But the best way to be there is by car, which takes about an hour to reach the destination.
  </p><br>
  <h5>2.  The Golden Circle</h5>
  <p>
    Another very popular day trip from Reykjavik, The Golden Circle boasts a myriad of places to unwind. The ‘Volcano Zone’ of Iceland, this part of the south coast is a vastly celebrated natural wonder, which also serves as an excellent energy provider to the islanders in producing sustainable energy. Talk about the breathtaking Gullfoss Waterfall, Strokkur Waterspout and bubbling pools at Geysir or the spectacular tectonic rift at Thingvellir National Park- everything is a rare adventure in the Golden Circle! Looks like too much work but this entire loop can easily be traversed in a day’s time, thanks to the close proximity to Reykjavik.
    Getting to the Golden Circle from Reykjavik is equal parts easy and exciting. You can rent anything from a bike to a Super Jeep, or take a bus up there.
  </p><br>
  <h5>3.  Snaefellsnes Peninsula</h5>
  <p>
    This is the most frequented part of western Iceland, with Snæfellsjökull being the main highlight of the area. Plenteous lava caves, shiny golden beaches, plummeting seaside cliifs, sparkling waterfalls and hot springs reside in this peninsula along with a gigantic volcanic glacier. Also nicknamed as ‘Iceland in Miniature’, it encompasses most of the country’s assets in its 100 km stretch. Surreal landscapes with autumn leaves and green moss covering the lava fields look like a painting.
    You can take one of the many buses commuting between Reykjavik and Snaefellsnes Peninsula that get you here in not more than 2 hours. Car ride is another easy option.
  </p><br>
  <h5>4.  Grimsey Island</h5>
  <p>
    Home to a hundred people living in harmony with a million seabirds, this bustling fishing hub is a jewel of Northern Iceland. Being a mecca for wildlife freaks, you might be lucky enough to encounter a polar bear that may drift from Greenland on rare occasions! Puffins, gorgeous little birds reside in maximum capacity here. And with millions of birds come zillions of eggs. So for eggitarians, this atoll is an absolute heaven!
    You can ride on ferries and boats to reach the island.
  </p><br>
  <h5>5.  Hvita</h5>
  <p>
    For hardcore adventurers who seek a spine-tickling thrill while vacaying in Reykjavik, the river rafting experience in the gorgeous Hvita river is inevitable! Flowing along the Glacier Langjokull, Hvita continues to eventually fall as the majestic Gullfoss waterfall. It cuts smoothly through serene canyons, while occasionally producing insane rapids and waves. At the end of it, you return to the base camp to indulge in a nice sauna while sipping in the picturesque vistas.
    An hour’s journey from Reykjavik, you can reach the banks og Hvita by bus or drive all by yourself!

  <h4>Best places to party in Reykjavik</h4>
  <p>
    Travelers often get misled by the secluded and quiet capital of Iceland, but Reykjavik knows it well how to raise the roof for party and carousal! Cafes and bars here pose a Jekyll & Hyde character, both serve beer and coffee all day long, before they turn the buzz on and convert into dancing floors!
    So if you are wondering why tourists and travel magazines are going gaga over the nightlife in Reykjavik (or Jammith as the locals say), check out these top 3 places to party in Reykjavik:
  </p><br>
  <h5>1. Laugavegur</h5>
  <p>
    The commercial artery of downtown Reykjavik dresses up to party after dusk, when bacchanals replace the shoppers and coffee drinkers turn into boozehounds. Kaffibarinn, Reykjavik’s coolest club, an old house with a London Underground symbol over the door, is mostly packed to capacity with musicians and hippies. For queens, there Kiki, an ostensible place to shake your booty on pop and electronica. The sweeping Mediterranean style décor and an outdoor patio at Café Oliver makes it another hot destination for party hunters.
    </p><br>
  <h5>2. Hverfisgata</h5>
  <p>
    This street runs parallel to the main street of Laugavegur. Earlier a ghetto to this geothermal capital, Hverfisgata has now smartened up after its facelift with trendy restros and shopping arenas. Celtic Cross, the Irish pub that brings you multiple beers on tap is ideal for game watchers, thanks to its big TV screen. Then there is Bar 101, posing a snob factor with its wealthiest jet set clientele. Hverfisbarinn is a haven for weekday partiers who are too much into live music; the place goes insane on Thursdays from 9pm to 11.30pm! Bar 11, another insanely popular rock playing, old-school bikers’ bar is ideal for people who aren’t much into dressing up or dancing.
    </p><br>
  <h5>3. Austurstraeti</h5>
  <p>
    Austurstraeti is another trending shopping and nightlife location in Reykjavik. Earlier a ‘back street’, Austurstraeti turned the limelight to itself only a few decades back. The place is replete with clubs and bars, but Austur outstands them all with its international charm and gorgeous interiors. It’s a party place for fancy pants who love to party in style. Then there’s American Bar, typical to its name with students partying on the latest MTV tunes. For veteran tasters, The English Pub offers over 35 brands of Whiskey and Beer, along with a bunch of big screens and TVs to grab a Soccer match.

  <h4>Best places to stay in Reykjavik</h4>
  <p>
    Reykjavik, a quaint small town clung to the corner of a largely uninhabited island, is as beautiful as the people living in it. Experiencing a tourism boom off late, the Icelandic capital has upgraded a lot in terms of accommodation and facilities.
    So if you are wondering where to stay in Reykjavik, here is a list of the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in the city:
  </p><br>
  <h5>1. Midborg</h5>
  <p>
    Icelanders have a habit of identifying neighborhoods with their postal codes, and 101 stands for the downtown, or Midborg. People seeking a stay in the heart of the city and in close proximity to the main touristy spots should base themselves here. Downtown Reykjavik is vibrant and vivacious with a lot of cafes, eateries, brand stores, museum and galleries keeping it tied up. But all this comes with a price; it’s hard to locate a pocket-friendly hotel in this area. Visit the Hallgrimskirkja Church, the Harpa Conference Hall and the lovely Tjornin (City Lake). Weekends in this neighborhood are often loud and boisterous, thanks to the raving Reykjavik nightlife concentrated mostly around Laugavedur, downtown’s main street.
  </p><br>
  <h5>2. Laugardalur</h5>
  <p>
    The eastern end of the city is all about cafes, restaurants and recreational activities. Laugardalur has a multi-faced personality with residences and businesses flourishing exponentially in a locality that has dedicated geo-thermal pools. It may not be as hip as the downtown, but a slew of family-themed attractions makes it a hit among group travelers. Take your little ones to the Reykjavik Zoo, Botanical Gardens and Laugardalsvallur Stadium. The hot pool complexes offer a perfect haven after a long day of foot-exploration of this tiny atoll. It rests on one end of Laugavedur, the hustling main street of Reykjavik; so you are stationed in close proximity to a lot of action!
  </p><br>
  <h5>3. Vesturbaer</h5>
  <p>
    To the west of the city centre is a rather quiet and vastly upscale neighborhood of Vesturbaer. The area has sea on both sides, which makes it a lot more picturesque than other localities. Major tourists aren’t much around here; National Museum of Iceland and the University of Iceland campus are on the eastern edge, while the Marine Museum is on the northern fringe. Vesturbaejarlaug, Reykjavik’s most famous geo-thermal pool lies in this area. Connectivity by buses is limited, so it’s better to walk to the main area. Rent a bike and you will reach downtown within 10-15 minutes!

  <h5>Day 13</h5>
  <p>
    Leave for Akureyri by a bus ride or a plane ride. It is recommended to book which ever option you choose, well ahead of time to get a good price. A plane ride would take 45 minutes to complete and is available throughout the week. A bus ride would take around 6 hours and 30 minutes to complete and is available twice every day. You can also choose to rent a car and drive up to Akureyri which would take you around 4 hours and 30 minutes to reach.
