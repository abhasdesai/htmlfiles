      <h5>Day 2 and 3 – Day trip options</h5>
      <h5>
        Holding a difference from the rest of the surrounding Poland, Warsaw is one of the most unique cities in the world. Instead of being built around an old market square, the entire capital is spread across a broad area with diverse architecture and restored Gothic, communist concrete along with modern glass and steel. Carrying a destructive past, there is a fascinating collection of neighbourhoods and landmarks, all intermixed with each other giving you a flavour of a different sort with every step you take. Along with this, the place will also provide you the opportunity for your culinary needs keeping it light on your wallet.
        Along with the bewildering past, for the complete Poland experience here are the best day trips from Warsaw:
      </h5><br>

      <h5>1. Kraków</h5>
      <p>
        Aptly considered a diamond in the rough, Kraków is a place with a mythical atmosphere rushing through veins. According to the fables, the city was founded on the defeat of a dragon, which convincingly permeates through its attractive streets and squares. The old town is brimming with some of the most impressive churches and museums along with Rynek Główny, the largest market square in Europe. Besides the culturally beautiful sites, there is a wide array of restaurants bars and clubs you will enjoy. Aside from the history and nightlife, try a simple stroll through the Old Town and you will be awed by the harmony of the quiet back street, the humble nature of the architecture and the light. This harmonious blend of past and present is one that shouldn't be missed.
        Located at almost 300 kms distance from Warsaw, the best option to travel is the train, taking a total rail time of 2h 30mins. Other options include bus 4h 45min and driving the way taking a little less than 4 hours.
      </p><br>
      <h5>2. Gdańsk</h5>
      <p>
        Another one of the unique towns in Poland, Gdańsk blessed with centuries of maritime ebb, is full of distinctively un-Polish architecture. Take a stroll down the narrow, cobbled streets of the Main Town to get lost in the wonder of monstrous red-bricked churches scattered along its historical thoroughfares bordered with slender, elegantly slender buildings. Along with this there a profusion of cheerful characterful cafes, amber shops and intriguing museums.
        Located at a distance of 415kms from Warsaw, the favourite mode of transport is the train taking 3 hours of rail while. Other options include cabs taking up to 5 hours and driving the way taking you 3h 45mins.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Lublin</h5>
      <p>
        A hotbed of culture, Lublin is the largest city in the south-eastern part of Poland. Thriving with cultural and academic scene, it is generally not considered a looker due to the ravage it faced during World War 2 and the forced industrialisation. However the historic core of the city, the Rynek is on a slow path of being gentrified complete with trendy clubs, cafes and restaurants providing a new lustre to the centre of the city. It is a place where you will find the remnant of Poland’s Jewish past, making it a special interest for the historians.
        Located at a distance of 176kms, the fastest and the most comfortable travel can be done on the rails taking 2h 30mins. Other options include bus taking 3 hours and cars taking 2h 15min.
      </p><br>
      <h5>4. Toruń</h5>
      <p>
        After seeing the hen crowds in Kraków and the concrete jungle of Warsaw, Toruń will be a pleasant sight to your eyes. Circumscribed with magnanimous walls, this Gothic town located near Vistuala shouldn't be missed. Having a wealth of red-brick buildings, UNESCO-listed sites and medieval city defences, which were mercifully ignored by the world war. Take a walk down the streets to witness the life before the wars in the most real sense possible.
        Located at distance of 267kms, the train is the best option taking a meagre time of 2h 45mins of travel time. Other options include buses taking 4 hours and cars taking 3 and a half hours.

      <h4>Best places to party in Warsaw</h4>
      <p>
        Warsaw witnessed an explosion of bars and clubs in the recent years, meaning travelers can grab a beer or some boogie at any hour of the day (Or night!). In fact, the party fervor has become so deeply rooted that popular nightclubs would shut the door right in your face even on a Wednesday night! Gorgeous people, all-night parties, international DJs, excellent venues and an overflow of alcohol and rock’n’roll makes Warsaw the best place to party in Poland.
        So as you junket your way across this part of Europe, spend the nights at the top 3 places to party in Warsaw:
      </p></br>
      <h5>1. Praga</h5>
      <p>
        To the eastern side of Warsaw, hugging the Vistula River is the gritty, hipster district of Praga. The imposing tower blocks and criminal underclass of this area kept the Westerners at bay for many years. But it now stands dignified after a revival of sorts, leaving a beautiful artsy underbelly and a wide variety of music to visitors’ probe. For those who find the cliché old town and city center distasteful, Praga is the ultimate mecca. The genuinely decrepit warehouses and abandoned factories have revamped themselves into lively nightclubs and bars, the most popular ones being Fabryka Trzciny, W Oparach Absurdu, Café Melon and Porto Praga.
       </p><br>
      <h5>2. Saska Kepa</h5>
      <p>
        For many years, this district of Warsaw was a major ‘no go’. But the past two decades gave Saska Kepa such a face-lift that it became an abode for the arts community, the nouveaux riche and intelligentsia! Under the shadow of The National Stadium, the area grew as a relentless sporting complex, giving way to millions of fans to party here. And with that sprung up umpteen trendy bars, cafes and nightclubs in the soon-to-be-called Little Village of Paris! But other than the ear-splitting nightclubs here, the neighborhood is a great place to simply wander around, watch people pass by and marvel at the architecture. Lizbonska Palace, Warsztat and Malinka are popular spots to party all night.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3.  Mazowiecka Street</h5>
      <p>
        The most popular street in Warsaw has worked hard enough to earn this accolade. For clubbers, it is the ultimate scene, offering everything from Jazz to House to Techno. The sidewalk is replete with countless bars, with the Zoo, Mono Bar, Tygmont Jazz Club and Enklawa stealing the show for quite some time now. Lemon and Utopia are mostly packed to capacity with booty shakers, but for pub seekers, there’s little to offer!

      <h4>Best places to stay in Warsaw</h4>
      <p>
        Warsaw is the greatest survival story of all times. After the wrath of World War II, Warsaw’s resurrection worked in its favor, giving way to a number of neighborhood and landmarks to unwind. From the Jewish Ghetto tragedy to the joyful Chopin’s music, explore it all in its maze of alleys and museums.
        So if you are planning to visit the Polish capital, base yourself at the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Warsaw. From affluent, full-service business hotels to quirky lodgings, to all things cheap- Warsaw offers everything your budget and type can hope for:
      </p></br>
      <h5>1. Stare Miasto (Old Town)</h5>
      <p>
        This part is stereotypical of most European medieval cities that pull a lot of tourists- a historic centre rested in the oldest part of the Polish city. Postcard-perfect plazas and cobblestone alleyways fill the place with a lot of antique charm. Popular tourist attractions in Warsaw like the Grand Theatre, St. John’s Cathedral and the Royal Castle and many eminent museums lie in this area. The square right next to the Royal Castle hosts abundant restaurants, cafes, bars and shops in it. People –watching can best be practiced in this part of Warsaw, where locals and tourists march day and night for work and leisure. Accommodations range from family-run hotels to contempo apartments.
       </p><br>
      <h5>2. Lazienki</h5>
      <p>
        A bathing pavilion was once located in this lush area, which later got redesigned by the last Polish king. This pleasant part of Warsaw owes its charm to the grand Lazienki Park. The White House, the Chopin House and the magnificent Palace on the Water are the main attractions of this area. From the city center, Lazienki is a short walk, hence things like the Royal Route and the Constitution Square can be reached at the blink of an eye. Try for an accommodation facing the park or the wonderful lake in it to get the best views in Warsaw.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Wola</h5>
      <p>
        The transformation of Wola from being an industrial district to the commercial center of Warsaw has brought it to limelight in the recent years. The famous Warsaw Rising Museum, a museum narrating the saga of World War II and insurgency, lies in this very neighborhood. Other than that, the area is replete with art galleries, theatres and cinema to keep the family travelers entertained. Accommodations range from extravagant to pocket-friendly, housing a number of popular restaurants serving authentic American and local cuisines.

        Krakow, one of the most ancient cities in Poland is the one of the largest too. Having grown significantly from a Stone Age settlement to Poland's second most important city, Krakow flaunts impeccable entertainment opportunities with its theatres, cabarets, clubs and wine cellars. What attracts the most of the travelers here is its historical monuments, recreation, religion and business. Though traditionally been one of the leading centers of Polish academic, cultural, and artistic life, the city is equally awe-inspiring in its castles and Gothic forms of the Polish city of kings.
        However, while planning a Polish vacation, it is important to look afar from this well endowed city as well. So check out a few lucrative options to choose from for the best day trips from Krakow:
</p><br>
      <h5>1. Ojców National Park</h5>
      <p>
        A place largely occupied by caves, castles and curious limestone cliffs, ravines and rock formations, Ojcow National Park is Poland's smallest national park, but nonetheless ranks among the most attractive recreational areas in the country! For its size, Ojcow houses way too many picturesque and worthy architectural monuments within its limits. After influx, walkers will be able to look into the chunky beech and fir forests and get lost between the needle-like splinters of limestone that make the park so famous. The nucleus of the Ojcow National Park consists of the Pradnik river valley with a road running along it as a spine – most beneficially for the enthusiastic motorists. To much of your surprise, Ojcow village in the park’s heart boasts the odds and ends of the 14th-century castle: Gothic gate, the Octagonal Tower, and ruins of a chapel.
        An enjoyable 20 minutes’ ride shall drop you off at Ojcow, whether you choose to traverse it via private cars or taxis.
    </p><br>
      <h5>2. Zakopane</h5>
      <p>
        Situated in the Tatra Mountains, Zakopane is a resort town, admired by skiers in winter as well as hikers and climbers year-round. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Zakopane evolved into a highly visible art colony, a breeding ground of culture that was ended by the Soviet influence after World War II. Today it lurks backward into a former time, inclusive of its gorgeous wooden houses. You can surely gather more information about these buildings and more at the Museum of Zakopane Style. It might be a self-proclaimed Winter Paradise, but this precious gem of a town is worth a stopover all year round. By summer, it pulses with the vigor of thousands of hikers and bikers, all eager to conquer its trails. In the winter, the snows dusts the cobbled streets, the surrounding pistes offer some of the best skiing experiences. But the main magnet of the Krupowki Street comes to life with the scents of frying sheep’s’ cheese, which is a popular local delicacy.
        It is at a distance of a 2 hour journey from Krakow for which you have train and bus services in reach.
    </p><br>
      <h5>3. Kryspinów Lake</h5>
      <p>
        A well-liked relaxation spot among Krakow-ians, there are two huge bodies of water formed on the site of a sand mine, that constitute the complex. When the humid summers of southern Poland are in their much famous vigor, there’s questionably nowhere better to go and cool off than the waters of Kryspinów Lake. This large basin has everything from well kept beaches to bars, thereby serving travelers with loads of picnic spots, and even a range of heart-pounding water sports in the form of windsurfing and blob jumps. It even comes with all the good wishes you would expect to find in a coastal resort including crystal clear waters, a swimming area complete with slides and a separate play area for younger children. An adventure zone has been added recently which features professional High Rope Courses and events and parties are also thrown in the course of summer.
        The Lake is a half an hour ride from Krakow and can easily be reached by bus.

      <h4>Best places to party in Krakow</h4>
      <p>
        Krakow, an urban legend for bacchanals and booze-lovers, claims to have the maximum concentration of bars across the planet. The sheer number of places to grab a drink includes everything ranging from cavernous cellars high on the student crowd to shady corner bars heaving with bohemians, to swanky Cocktail bars serving all things fancy! The wide range of Polish vodkas can be a nightmare to miss!
        From hitting the dance floor to sitting in peace at a live concert, Krakow hosts all kinds of partiers. So when partying across the city, try the top 3 places to party in Krakow:
      </p><br>
      <h5>1. Kazimierz</h5>
      <p>
        With a parallel name of Jewish Quarter, Kazimierz is a charming and cozy neighborhood in daylight that displays unfathomable bustle after dark. Those seeking an artistic climate full of non-generic party venues, this the best district in Krakow. The hipster-like area offers many lesser-known brew brands, themed parties, alternative band concerts and plenty of dancing. Fantastic street food and excellent local delicacies can be grabbed at any nook and corner. Price to party is not as steep as in the other touristy parts of Krakow. Alchemia, Absynt, le Scandale, Singer, Hamsa- these are some popular nightspots in Kazimierz.
      </p><br>
      <h5>2. Old Town</h5>
      <p>
        Practically, every historical building in the Old Town houses a cellar-based pub, club or a restaurant. With such an insane competition, most party places are open till 5 am in the morning, giving way to infinite after-partying. Disco, jazz, rock, house, folk, reggae- every music buff can locate his taste in this district in Krakow. Baccarat is a faddish and ambitious nightclub in the area, seriously large and insanely overloaded woth alcohol variety. Black Gallery is a quirky, hidden garden that puts the obvious nightspots in Krakow to shame with its live music and blue kamikaze shots. Then there is Movida Cocktail Bar for the high-browed and hanky-panky ones, where the staff concocts slurpy mixes to excite your taste buds!
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Szewska</h5>
      <p>
        For hardcore hedonists who aren’t familiar with the idea of sleeping at night, the buzzing street of Szewska demands an inevitable visit. Home to the greatest Krakow nightclubs of all times, this up and coming street never seems to rest! Shaker’s Club, an offbeat cellar offers a relaxed lounge-like feel with a dance-floor in the same premises. Frantic, a highly sought after nightspot in Krakow hosts about 500 revelers in a night! The Goraczka Freak Club, like its name, will drive you crazy with the pounding tunes.
      </p><br>

      <h4>Best places to stay in Krakow</h4>
      <p>
        The mythical past of the truly legendary town of Krakow still sort of permeates in its magnificent architecture. Soaring spires, quaint churches, majestic museums and the infinite Rynek Glowny, Europe’s larest market- tourist attractions in Krakow can keep you busy for a nice, long vacation. The royal Polish city is a harmonious blend of past and present, offering way more than just nightlife and history.
        So if you are ready to delve into the dragon warrior city, prefer a base in the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Krakow:
      </p><br>
      <h5>1. Old Town</h5>
      <p>
        The most central and historic quarter of the city, Old Town is unarguably the best place to stay in Krakow. Like every major European town, all the main tourist spot lie in proximity to this area. It survived the wrath of World War II, thus getting the UNESCO World Heritage certificate. The Planty, a mildly forested parkland circumscribing this area was once the Old Town’s Wall and Moat. Rynek Glowny is the main market square that branches out all the streets. Click a selfie with the Town Hall Tower, the gorgeous Wawel Castle or the Florian Gate. Being super central and ultra picturesque obviously raises the stakes for tourists seeking an accommodation here.
      </p><br>
      <h5>2. The Jewish Quarter</h5>
      <p>
        Kazimierz (the same) is too cool to handle! There are so many hip cafes, eateries, art galleries and bars that you might actually fall short of time exploring this district in Krakow. Hardly a 20 minute walk from the Central square, Kazimierz is home to beautiful synagogues, the Jewish Cemetery and the tunes of authentic Jewish Klezmer music! Try a Kosher meal at one of the traditional restros as you head out to unwind the Schindler’s List locations. Accommodations range from thrifty to affluent, with private apartments seeing an upsurge. Backpackers flood this place like none other, hence even the low-budget locations offer most basic amenities.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Podgorze</h5>
      <p>
        A large residential area with an up and coming buzz, Podgorze was once the Jewish Ghetto of Krakow. For frequent visitors who don’t mind a little distance from the tourist buzz and popular attractions, this area is a perfect haven to feel the city instead of just flipping through the main touristy spots. Locals keep this area alive and kicking, thus creating a bustling riverfront escape. Accommodations are darn cheap and adequately modish!
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Day 7 – Leave for Brno (Czech) by a train ride, a bus ride or car related options. A bus ride is an economical option that takes around 5 hours to complete and is available 5 times a day. A train ride would require you to change trains at a particular station, depending upon the train you choose. Trains from Krakow to Brno are available thrice or twice a day while the second train you catch is available by the hour so transferring shouldn’t be too much of a problem. Car related options such as sharing a car, is also an economical option and takes little over 4 hours to complete.

        Brno, a ghastly understated capital city in Czech Republic, has for many years had a dull rep, thanks to the popular local movie ‘Boredom in Brno’. However, with tens of thousands of students reappraising the city’s image with vibrant club scenes and lively cafes, Brno can easily rival Prague in terms of offerings. Known for its modernist buildings, we bet the travelers haven’t seen an atmosphere as authentic and lively as Brno’s. Surprisingly, the Moravian capital has yet to be discovered by mass tourism, meaning that prices and crowds are both minimal and manageable.
        So as you traverse through Brno, spare a day or two for these equally charming day tours that can be taken from this city. Check out these best day trips from Brno to know more:terlaken:
      </p><br>
      <h5>1. Moravian Karst and Caves</h5>
      <p>
        The Moravian Karst is an eminent landscape reserve to the north of Brno. Located by the eastern part of the Czech Republic, the town of Blansko is stationed close to the main city. Refreshing air and stunning caverns that make this place famous, make it to the top position of the day trips when in Brno. The Karst area is spread throughout a stretch of 100 square kilometers and has multitudes of caves and gorges, four of which are open to the public for self-guided tours. For ones with an adventurous streak, a number of less-traveled caverns can be visited with a qualified guide. You’d be at a great loss on missing the boat tour along an underground river. The Macocha Abyss is also of good importance with numerous excellent walking trails.
        Located at an easy 30 minute distance from Brno, the most convenient mode of travel is by train.
      </p><br>
      <h5>2. Znojmo</h5>
      <p>
        Znojmo, a historic town centre with beautiful churches engulfed by medieval city walls, has preserved its Renaissance appearance and authentic charm. Abounding with crooked lanes, romantic views and picturesque nooks and corners to much interest of travelers, it is also the centre of a well-known wine region, offering a great chance to sample some local produce. Apart from the much tempting wine tasting, Wine tourists can also visit the Modré sklepy (Blue Cellars) complex in Nový Šaldorf, where the cellar lane is amongst the most picturesque in the Znojmo region. You can also pay a humble visit at the nearby region of Slup to see the popular and historic water mill. Other attractive destinations are the Vranov nad Dyjí Chateau, and the famous Bítov Castle. Another dominant feature of the town is the Church of St. Nicholas boasting the likes of the original Baroque pulpit in the shape of the globe. For history enthusiasts, the town is home to some breathtaking medieval architecture marvels, including the Gothic Church of St. Nicholas, the tower of the City Hall, and nearby Znojmo Castle, which today serves as a museum and gallery.
        Hardly an hour away from Brno, you can reach Znojmo via bus, train, or private taxis.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Olomouc</h5>
      <p>
        78 kilometers northeast of Brno, Olomouc is one of the larger cities in the Czech Republic that has some really beautiful, old architecture dating from the 10th century,  as well as an active arts and cultural scene that include the Moravian Theatre, the Moravian Philharmonic Orchestra, and numerous museums and galleries. The reminiscent central streets are sprinkled with beautiful churches that are flocked ceaselessly by Catholics. The main square is one of the country’s most eminent and beautiful, encircled by numerous historic buildings and sanctified by a UNESCO-protected trinity column. Other than that, the city is a religious metropolis and historical capital city of Moravia, located on the Morava River.
        An hour ride from Brno, we suggest you go there by train. The bus ride, however, shall take around 1 hour 30 minutes to reach Olomouc.

      <h4>Best places to stay in Brno</h4>
      <p>
        When asked from the natives, the image of Brno is not considered to be very lively. Especially after the release of the movie Nuda v Brne, its image worldwide has also taken a hit and not many people are now convinced to travel here. The truth about Brno is however not even close to this much-hyped opinion. The students attending the university here can ensure the presence of several lively pubs and bars that can easily compete with that of Prague. To the list of credentials, one can also add some excellent microbreweries and at least two of the country's best restaurants.
        With countless reasons to let travellers have a great sojourn, Brno is no less than Prague! So here is a list of the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Brno.
      </p><br>
      <h5>1. Brno-north</h5>
      <p>
        The second largest neighbourhood in Brno, Brno North currently holds an estimate of around forty seven thousand residents. Large areas of mature and well-kept greenery among the low-density buildings, this place is one of the best sought after to live simply because of the surroundings. Not just the beautiful landscapes but the proximity with the centre makes sure that you're never missing out on anything. Be it restaurants or cafes, everything is at an arm’s distance from the point of accommodation. With such a picturesque location and close proximity of all things touristy, this north face serves perfectly to wanderlusts.
      </p><br>
      <h5>2. Kralovo Pole</h5>
      <p>
        Kralovo Pole stands out as one of the oldest and largest housing developments in Brno. A well connected place, this district in Brno is profuse with tunnels connecting the outer city ring road, the Zaboverska Street and the Svitavska radial route, making it one of the best and finest connected neighbourhoods. Though a little congested due to the excess infrastructure, shopping centres and the Vodova Sports Areas, this is one of the highly demanded places for accommodation simply for its luxurious living and the ‘city within city’ sort of working. Some of the other things advocating your stay here include the Carthusian monastery on Bozetechova Street, acting as a standing epitome of beauty.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Medlanky</h5>
      <p>
        Perceived as the smallest housing development in Brno, Medlanky is one of those postcard-perfect areas for accommodation. That been said, a large part of the neighbourhood is still not adequately constructed, with the north-western area still densely forested, but serving as a gorgeous epicenter of many cottages and gardens. Hence, the largest selling point of the neighborhood is its inclination towards the natural setting and high quality of life. The general housing though is beautiful, can take a huge chunk of your savings!
        </p><br>
        <h5>
          Day 9 – Leave for Prague by a train ride, a bus ride or car related options. A train ride is available by the hour in a day and takes 2 hours and 30 minutes to complete. A bus ride is also available by the hour in a day and takes the same amount of time as a train ride to reach Prague. Car related options such as car sharing would take 2 hours and 44 minutes to complete.

        <h5>Day 11 and Day 12 – Day trip options</h5>
        <p>
          Prague, the largest city in the Czech Republic and also the former capital of Bohemia, was once Europe’s most beautiful and romantic cities. Even today, the city manages to boast an enchanting riverside and a skyline dotted with hundreds of golden spires shimmering in the sun. Having largely avoided the architectural purge of the Cold War, the city’s medieval Old Town looks much as it did a thousand years ago. It is somewhat still evident through the cobblestone streets winding across spacious city squares.
          While it is indeed tempting and intriguing to spend an entire holiday exploring Prague’s architectural, musical and culinary delights, these listed best day trips from Prague offer the curious travelers a few rewarding experiences as well:
        </p><br>
        <h5>1. Krivoklat Castle</h5>
        <p>
          Burned down to dust a number of times but constantly rebuilt with pride and hard work, Krivoklat Castle has finally manages to turn the tables in its favor and begun to function well. Today, the castle works as a historic museum, tourist spot and a place for theatrical exhibitions. Collections of weapons, Gothic paintings and books are stored there. Perched on top of a forested hill, Krivoklat was built as a residence for the royals during the 13th century. Its isolated location has helped to preserve the castle’s Gothic interiors, which are filled with paintings, art and more than 50 thousand volumes of books. Once also served as a house for political prisoners, visitors have felt the eerie presence of some unusual reminders of its darker past. Surprisingly, even the carvings in the Royal Chapel depict angels bearing instruments of torture.
          One hour away from Prague, you can visit Krivoklat Castle via day excursion buses, public buses and private taxis. You can also travel by train, but will have to switch trains on the way at Beroun, taking a total travel time of 2 hours 15 minutes. Taxis on the contrary, take hardly an hour but leave a hole in your pocket.
        </p><br>
        <h5>2. Castle Karlstejn</h5>
        <p>
          This castle is a large and most frequently visited Gothic castle founded 1348 CEby Charles IV and the King of Bohemia. Located about 30 kilometers south-west of Prague, Karlstejn castle is an easy day trip from this main city, which makes it a convenient and popular attraction for tourists and locals alike. A short and beautiful trek up to the hilltop fortress offers mesmerizing views of towers and turrets as well as the pretty town at the bottom. Inside, the star attraction is the Chapel of the Holy Cross where the king’s jewels were kept. Although the castle has been completely restored to its original medieval state, most rooms are off limits to the general public. The castle’s storybook façade, nevertheless, makes Karlstejn quite worth a visit.
          Around 45 minutes to 1 hour minutes away from Prague, you can get here by train, buses and tram as well.
        </p><br>
        <h5>3. Cesky Krumlov</h5>
        <p>
          This town in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic is a historic centre, highlighted by a Castle, and a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. Most of the architecture of the old town and castle dates from the 14th through 17th centuries; the town's structures are mostly in Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque styles. Do not miss the museum dedicated to the painter Egon Schiele, who lived in the town, as it is sure to poke your art instincts. In addition to the castle’s exquisite interiors, the grounds feature a large Rococo-style garden with a recently restored elaborate fountain. With its original on-stage machinery, props and scenes, the castle’s Baroque theatre is a much frequented spot as well.
          There has been a direct train to Prague since 2016, with a traveling time of 2 hours 50 minutes. Several bus companies operate direct bus services to Prague. There are also direct shuttle mini bus services to major cities including Prague, Munich and Vienna.
