The city’s eastern bank houses the Muslim face of the city, while the western comprises mostly of Catholic Croats. Savour a typical Bosnian meal based on dairy products, a delicious pastry and Cevapi. For shopaholics, there’s the Old Bazaar, letting you indulge in some street haggling for local crafts.
About 140 km from Dubrovnik, drive your way along the Adriatic Coast on a beautiful road, taking about 2 hours to reach. Alternatively, bus services take about 3-4 hours to get you there.

        <h5>4. Vjetrenica Cave</h5>
        <p>
          Again, located in Bosnia & Herzegovina, this one’s the largest cave in the vicinity. The exact length of the cave is still unknown, but they say it goes on from Dubrovnik to the island of Sipan. Take a good long walk in the 6,000 m passages to gawk at the intense rocky formations. For the bravehearts, there are thousands of bats waiting to be to explored!
Vjetrenica is only an hour’s drive from Dubrovnik. It’s a beautiful drive out there, offering many points to stop by and take pictures.
        </p><br>
        <h5>5. Neretva River Safari</h5>
        <p>
          For outdoor enthusiasts, there’s no better day trip than the picturesque Neretva River Valley. A perfectly peaceful break from the city bustle, right in nature’s lap, this area renders loads of activities, organized or spontaneous. Rent a traditional Ladja or Trupa boat to unravel the waters here, or try kite or windsurfing in the neighbourhood. You can even try harvesting your own mandarin, before you settle in for a scrumptious local delicacy, specialising in eel stew and frog.
Hardly 70 km from Dubrovnik, you can drive down in about an hour and a half. You can even register yourself for a guided tour, after which the company takes care of your transfers.
        </p><br>
        <h5>6. National Park Mljet</h5>
        <p>
          Unarguably the greenest isle of Croatia, half of Mljet is a well protected National Park since 1960. Unscathed nature, clear blue waters and lakes, a well groomed shore and rich cultural heritage create a true paradise here in Mljet. Its two deep bays- the Great Lake and the Small Lake besides the famous Saplunara Beach are must-visit attractions on this day trip. On the Islet of St. Mary rests the 12th century Benedictine Monastery, another hot favourite for historians.
You can reach Mljet via a Catamaran service that runs from Dubrovnik throughout the year, taking about 2 hours of travel time.

      <h5>Best places to party in Dubrovnik</h5><br>
      <p>
        Looking for an updated, fresh mini guide to the Dubrovnik nightlife, here goes! After you are done walking in the old city walls, soaking up the Adriatic sun on nearby beaches and touring a bunch of museums, wind up your day in the cobbled streets here to live and enjoy the local nightlife scene in Dubrovnik.

      </p><br>
      <p>
        So look no further than these top 3 places to party in Dubrovnik:
      </p>
      <h5>1. Old Town</h5>
      <p>
        Sleepy all through winters, Dubrovnik wakes up with hope in the hot season, when the Old Town springs to life with its umpteen nightclubs, bars and pubs. Bars in Dubrovnik are quite compact in size. Hip young Croatians mingle with the tourists over a cup of coffee, a glass of wine or a fancy cocktail. The most unique of all is D’Vino Wine Bar, a tiny hideout hidden in a narrow stone alley, boasting exposed stone walls. To try some authentic Croatian booze, visit La Bodega, a 17th century building close to the Rector’s Palace.
        </p><br>
      <h5>2. Bay of Lapad</h5>
      <p>
        Enjoy an opulent evening right by the simmering Adriatic sea in one of the lovely beachside nightlife locations in Dubrovnik. Partiers travel by land and sea to the Lapad Bay to have the dreamiest night outs ever. The main walking strip is lined with cafes, bars and parks. Try a drink inside of a rock at the Cave Bar More, an actual cave with barren stone walls and cutting-edge interiors. Midway through the Lapad Bay strip is Luma Restaurant and Lounge, an open air terrace nestled in the shade of magnolia trees and wild chestnuts. Then there is Coral Beach Club to render you magical vistas of the Daksa Island.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Copacabana Beach</h5>
      <p>
        Located below the Babin Kuk settlement of Dubrovnik is this pebble beach with a shallow sea. Besides offering a large number of daytime activities in the waters, Copacabana hosts a vivacious nightlife after sundown. Saturday nights are booked for ‘Beat That Beat’ where DJs from all across the continent come to perform. Moet Parties, Open air Cinemas and impeccable seafood make this beach very popular among tourists.
        </p>
      <p>
        Bars and Pubs in Dubrovnik mostly cater to standing guests; it’s the best way to strike a conversation or bear the crowded, small joints. Nightlife in Dubrovnik is generally not an all-night affair. Bars and pubs wind up by 1 am, albeit some places function till wee hours in disguise. Overall, this cultural hub of Croatia is way too livelier in the daytime than after dark.

      <h5>Best places to stay in Dubrovnik</h5><br>
      <p>
        Dubrovnik has become a hot favorite tourist destination after it got trotted out in the epic Game of Thrones. With the Adriatic sea on one side, rocky mountains on the other and an overdose of medieval charm in its heart, Dubrovnik is surely a magical European town.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Being a relatively compact city, Dubrovnik is fairly easy to explore. So check out the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Dubrovnik:
      </p>
      <h5>1. Ploce</h5>
      <p>
        Ploce Gate- the southern entrance of the Old Town is nestled on the coast, immediately south of the city walls. It is a beautifully sandwiched district between Banje Beach and Sveti Jakov Pebble cove. Frano Supilo Street here houses the most esteemed here, looking over the Lokrum islet. Perched uphill, you get gorgeous vistas of the floodlit Dubrvonik fortifications. Its elegance and close proximity to the old town makes it the perfect place to stay for first time visitors to Dubrovnik. For many, it is a more souped up location than the popular Old Town, as you get to enjoy the medieval town’s attractions and nightlife while staying away from the noise and bustle.
      </p><br>
      <h5>2. Lapad Peninsula</h5>
      <p>
        Cutting-edge waterside hotels, expansive water sports in a sheltered west-facing islet with a pebble beach north-west of the Old Town- Lapad Bay is a great choice for the leisure vacationers who prefer some cultural sightseeing. The place is hardly a 15 minute bus ride from the Old Town. Large number of beaches rest in this area, with the ones stationed deeper in the peninsula being most crowded. For an intimate atmosphere, prefer the ones nestles on the edge of the peninsula. The area’s famous promenade is a hustling retreat for the travelers, offering many restaurants, boutiques, cafés and bars to explore.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3.  Gruz</h5>
      <p>
        Gruz, a busy harbor and yacht marina is locals’ favorite marketplace in Dubrovnik. It lies in close proximity to the islets of Elaphiti, Korcula and Mljet and also serves as the docking area for cruise ships. The district is mostly a residential area while being a haven for yacht owners and charter companies. Several wine bars and pretty little restaurants have sprung up in the neighborhood of late. Return visitors choose this district to be their permanent resting place. And the best part, hotels of all budgets can be located in this chirpy area.
