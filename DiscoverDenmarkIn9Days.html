      <h4>Best places to party in Copenhagen</h4>
      <p>
        In Copenhagen, a great night implies a late night. Crazy weekends with Danes crowding the nightclubs until sunrise have given Copenhagen a reputation contradictory to its highbrow cultural side exemplified by operas ballets and theaters. Earlier popular for its jazz music, the city has expanded its night scene with many dance clubs, wine cellars and traditional beer houses flourishing around.
        Check out the hottest top 3 places to party in Copenhagen as you gawk at some best looking eye candies in Europe:
      </p></br>
      <h5>1. Vesterbro</h5>
      <p>
        The young and happening set of Danish population hits Vesterbro after midnight. Most of the cafes in this bustling locality of Copenhagen turn into cocktail bars on weekend nights. Popular rock and pop bands hit the stage at Vega, a former trade union hall that is now a premier nightclub of Copenhagen. Try Brasss Monkey, city’s first Tiki Bar or Markbar if you are looking for a quaint and uptight basement nightclub. Vesterbro is a cheaper alternative to the hanky-panky nightclubs who check you head-to-toe before letting you in.
       </p><br>
      <h5>2. Osterbro</h5>
      <p>
        The low-key partiers with a little more sedate mood prefer Osterbro for its traditional beer houses and wine cellars, albeit there are a number of lively bars, cocktail clubs and offbeat theaters in this area. Park is the perfect complex to party, grab a coffee or may be a theater performance. Café Bopa is another big hit among the students for its live music sessions and DJ nights. Besides this, Copenhagen’s only South African bar Macgraths rests in Osterbro, an authentic iron bar with a sports-obsessed atmosphere.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Stroget</h5>
      <p>
        Danes claim it to be the most lively and snappy neighborhood for night owls. Stroll around Stroget to see jugglers, musicians and street artists before you step into one of the umpteen bars or beer houses. The legendary Copenhagen Jazzhouse hosts both local and international jazz performances before the disco takes over after midnight. In the daytime too, it’s a great escape for walkers and pedestrian explorers, thanks to its no-vehicle area status. Nightclubs in Stroget are considerably spacious with huge dance floors and descent sitting areas.

      <h4>Best places to stay in Copenhagen</h4>
      <p>
        The vivacious capital of the world’s oldest kingdom brings you the most vibrant architecture, sweeping canals, bicycles skittering all over and the friendly Danish locals. The entire city can easily be accessed on bike, with all the main spots in close vicinity.
        But every neighborhood in Copenhagen has its own character. So take a moment to decide your style and budget, and choose among the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Copenhagen:
      </p></br>
      <h5>1. Indre By (City Centre)</h5>
      <p>
        The oldest neighborhood of Copenhagen (it began to flourish in 1167!) is Indre By, the inner city. A maze of medieval alleys and lively squares, it’s unarguably the chirpy heart of the capital city. Stroget, one of the world’s longest pedestrian streets stretches through this area from Kongens Nytorv in the east to Radhuspladsen in the west. City centre boasts Denmark’s rich architectural and artistic past with its historical buildings, museums and churches, primarily the legendary Rundetarn. Exploring this area on foot is immense pleasure, especially for patrons who love to explore big brand stores. This neighborhood is ideal if you wish to ‘feel’ Copenhagen!
       </p><br>
      <h5>2. Vesterbro</h5>
      <p>
        Once a Red-light district of Copenhagen is now a swanky district exhibiting ethnic eateries, markets, nightlife and street arts. It lies to the south of City Centre and hosts the largest convergence of hotels in Copenhagen. Halmtorvet, the main plaza here is swarming with cafes and bars, live music and upscale lounges. Frederiksberg, the far end of Vesterbrogade is the wealthiest neighborhood around that houses some of the most affluent parks and villas of the city. For travelers who seek culture, this locality hosts a lot beyond shopping avenues and eateries. All in all, Vesterbro hosts an electric vibe and suits travelers who don’t mind some noise.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Christianshavn</h5>
      <p>
        Replete with canal everywhere, this residential neighborhood lies to the East of the city. Travelers call it ‘Little Amsterdam’ with its old Dutch houses, abundant canals and cobbled streets.  Inderhavnen, Copenhagen prime waterway, separates Christianshavn from the rest of the city. Connectivity to the city center is copious with many public transports and biking paths, besides a large number of bridges. Visit the Opera House and Vor Frelsers Kirke Church as you stroll through the ‘free city’ of Christiania. Christianshavn is an ideal hippie commune with endless charm and magnificence!
