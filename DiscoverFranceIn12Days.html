      <h5>Day 3/Day 4 – Day trip options</h5>
      <h5>
        The mystifying smile of Mona Lisa, the monumental Eiffel tower, the enigmatic pyramid of the Louvre along with scores of cathedrals and museums, Paris is a place that can tantalize all your senses. A city of legacies, lights, luxuries and love, Paris today stands as a city flourishing with art, tourism, culture. However, the city may astound you with its abundance in architecture and heritage, but it’s the finer aspects of the city like the cobbled pathways, the quaint boutiques, the celebration and preservation of its culture which truly enchants you and makes Paris truly unique.
        In fact, just as this French jewel is richly endowed in assets, so are its neighboring towns. Take a walk through the various neighborhoods outside of Paris and you will find that it has something for everyone! Check out these best day trips from Paris to know more:
      </h5><br>

      <h5>1. Mont Saint Michel</h5>
      <p>
        Vast mud flats give way to the rise of the rocky island of Mont Saint Michel, a gorgeous piece of atoll in the northwestern part of Normandy. The city looks like a construction of medieval structures stacked over one another, with the Abbey of Mont Saint Michel crowning atop. A rugged causeway connects the island with the mainland, which turns into a muddy sandbar in low tide season and can easily be crossed by foot.
There are no direct trains or buses from Paris to Mont Saint Michel. So the best mode of commutation would be to reach Pontorson by train, and then cover the last leg of your journey by bus.
        </p><br>
      <h5>2. Loire Valley</h5>
      <p>
        The spectacular villages, sprawling vineyards and picturesque landscapes of the Loire Valley justify to the splendor and gastronomy you seek while visiting France. This fertile river valley is ornate with hundreds of extravagant fortresses, thanks to all those kings, queens and dukes who established their feudal castles and pleasure palaces in this neighborhood. From defense fortresses to opulent country manors, these Chateaux draw thousands of tourists every year. Don’t miss the popular ones like Amboise, Rivau, Chinnon, Chambord and Chenonceau.
To reach the valley, you need an hour if traveling by train, and two hours if driving your way through the panoramic countryside.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Versailles</h5>
      <p>
        A trip to France is incomplete without a day well spent at Versailles. Located immediate southwest of Paris, its star attraction is the Palace of Versailles. There are very few palaces in the world that can stand a chance compared to the opulence and offerings of this grandiose spire. Works by Leonardo da Vinci, the Hall of Mirrors, fascinating statuary, picturesque walkways and carefully beautified grounds make the place a perfect location for a day trip.
Versailles is conveniently connected to Paris by Metro and bus services. A road trip is another great option to reach the destination.
      </p><br>
      <h5>4. Fontainebleau</h5>
      <p>
        To seek an alternative to Versailles and a respite from extreme tourist hustle, Fontainebleau turns out to be a perfect day trip from Paris. Located in a former Royal forest, the gigantic Palace of Fontainebleau awaits history-lovers with its 1500 rooms of French magnificence! With architecture equally as rich as that of Versailles (even more!) and grounds gorgeously manicured, Fontainebleau is also home to a lot of nice food shops and cafes. Take a horse drawn carriage ride around the palace or try your hands at a hot-air balloon ride to see this opulently low-key town from up above. If done with the palace charm, take a stroll in its expansive forest areas.
Fontainebleau is a mere 45 minute journey by train. Even the car ride doesn’t cost more than an hour to reach from Paris to Versailles.
      </p><br>
      <h5>5. Giverny</h5>
      <p>
        A wonderful place to unravel especially during summer and spring, Giverny owes its fame to Monet’s impeccable Water Lily paintings. While walking across his home and gardens in this town, you would actually feel like living in one of his paintings! For nature and serenity seekers, this place is an absolute bliss!
A train journey gets you from Paris to Vernon in about 45 minutes. From there, Giverny is about 4 km away. You can even rent a taxi to reach the place on time while indulging in beautiful landscapes.

      <h5>Best places to stay in Paris</h5>
      <p>
        Paris- the City of Lights, turns out to be a vacation of a lifetime for many travelers. Although its infamously garish reputation of being unaffordable breaks many vacaying hearts, but if you play your cards right, you can explore Paris at its best while keeping your pocket safe.
Paris is divided into 20 Arrondissements (Neighborhoods), with the lowest number being closer to the center of the city. Here are the Top 3 Arrondissements for accommodation for a tourist in Paris:</p><br>
      <h5>1. The Marais (3rd-4th Arrondissement)</h5>
      <p>
        Marais is a wonderful, art-filled, centrally-located district with several attractions in close proximity like Pompidou, Musee Picasso and Hotel de Ville. Other main spots such as The Louvre are at a walking distance as well. This extremely safe area is gay friendly and hosts medieval architecture. The famous Jewish Quarter houses excellent shops, restaurants and cafes. A nighttime entertainer for the locals, Marais serves a perfect shopping experience for the hippie fashionistas. Stroll on rue Charlot on a Sunday to enjoy the unpretentious art galleries restaurants and wineries. Night scene is quite intense with all the major action going on in this vicinity.</p><br>

      <h5>2. 9th Arrondissement</h5>
      <p>
        The 9th one isn’t really big on attractions, but it’s truly Parisian to the core. It is mostly a residential zone that has The Opera and Galleries-Lafayette Departmental Store on one side and the edge of Montmarte on the other. Despite being so closely positioned to Central Paris, it is ghastly under-crowded, which is great for peace seekers. A lot of great cafes and eateries rest in this locality, with Moulin Rouge, Palais Garnier and a bunch of strip joints being at a walking distance. All in all, it’s a great base for tourists who wish be close to the main attractions by away from the city bustle.
      </p><br>

      <h5>3. Belleville (19th-20th Arrondissement)</h5>
      <p>
        If you are done with all those cliché touristy places and seek a more hipster vibe now, try Belleville. Home to a bunch of varied communities, it is the gentrified area of the French capital. For gourmands, it is absolute heaven, thanks to its wide selection of ethnic food catering mostly to African and Middle Eastern cuisines. Museum of Science and Industry rests in this area along with Buttes-Chaumont, a great place to take your kids. Hotels and hostels are fairly prices if you are traveling on budget.

      <p>
        Majestically perched on a hill overlooking the Provence countryside, Saint-Paul de Vence is a typical ancient village near Nice. The town retaining its medieval charms offers you a peek-a-boo into the well-preserved circle of 16th-century ramparts.  Having been built in the 14th century in the Romanesque style highlighted by the Baroque Chapel of Saint Clement, the Collegiate Church is a must visit place. The beauty of the town can be best experienced by wandering in the narrow cobblestone streets that wind through the village, witnessing plenteous delightful fountains, pleasant squares, and colourful art galleries.

      <h5>3. Eze</h5>
      <p>
        Another typical Euro medieval village, Eze is the epitome of "village perché" clinging to the edge of a steep conical rock. Known as "nid d'aigle" by the locals (meaning eagle's nest), this village has a very dramatic location lying about 427 meters above the Mediterranean Sea. Home to some of the most beautiful sights of sunsets and sunrises, Eze has the cultural integrity in the form of Church Belfry and the ruins of the ancient fortress visible from a great distance. However, the best way to experience the village is by taking a stroll through the charming cobblestone streets and alleyways that exhibit cute little boutiques and small courtyards.
There are three ways to get from Nice to Eze; a car ride taking about 30 minutes and buses taking around 40 minutes. But the best and most offbeat way is by hiring a bike that would take an hour and a half but provide you with a breath of fresh air.
