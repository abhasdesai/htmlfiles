      <h5>Day 3 – Day trip options</h5>
      <h5>
        Athens, the capital city of Greece and also the largest, dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest establishments, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years! Its earliest human presence started somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennium BC; almost when we began to turn from apes to humans! The leftover footmarks of the classical era are still prevalent in many parts of the city, represented by ancient monuments and works of art. The most famous is the Parthenon, considered a major landmark of early Western civilization. Besides, Athens also has its Roman and Byzantine monuments intact, as well as a smaller number of Ottoman monuments.
        As breathtaking as its heritage might be, there is no harm planning a few day-tours from Athens. Here are our recommendations for the best day trips from Athens:
      </h5><br>

      <h5>1. Cape Sounion and the Temple of Poseidon</h5>
      <p>
        The Temple of Poseidon at Sounion is the best day trip you can do out of Athens. The temple has Doric style columns and was built in the 5th Century BC. It is supposedly erected on the location of an older temple. You are not allowed to enter the temple anymore because it is roped off. However, you can get close enough to appreciate it and be awestruck. If conscious enough, one might even read the symbols carved on the ancient columns, some of which are known to be even hundreds of years old. Below the temple you will find a small bay with the Aegeon Beach Hotel which is as close as you can get to being on a Greek island this near to Athens without really being on a Greek island. During the summer months, you can swim in the crystal clear waters of a nearby beach and have some fresh seafood in a seafront tavern. Don’t forget to admire one of the most magnificent sunsets when in town.</p>
      <p>Catch the bus, or opt for private taxis. Approx travel time for any transportation is 1 hour 20 minutes.
        </p><br>
      <h5>2. Delphi</h5>
      <p>
        Delphi occupies an impressive and strategic site on the south-western edge of Mount Parnassus, overlooking the beautiful coastal plain to the south and the Phocis valley. Now a fascinating archaeological site with a modern town of the same name quite near to it, on your day trip to Delphi, do not miss the chance to visit the Temple of Apollo, the ancient theatre and the archaeological museum. In the inner hearth of the Temple of Apollo, an eternal flame burns. On your way, you can also stop by the nearby village of Arachova, which happens to be a very popular winter resort. A lucrative opportunity to delve in the realms of ancient history and glory, Delphi is not the day tour you would want to miss at all.</p>
        <p>3 hours away from Athens, you can choose between bus tours, public bus services and taxis to get there.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Mycenae, Epidaurus and Nafplio</h5>
      <p>
        On this day trip to Peloponnese, you will visit some of the most extensive and renowned archaeological sites of Greece and Mycenae. Mycenae was the city of mythical Agamemnon, the hero of the Trojan War. Once there, you will have the chance to visit the archaeological site and stand jaw-slacked by the intricacy with which its history is woven. It is also accompanied by a beautiful museum. Nearby is the archaeological site of Asklipieion. It is believed to be one of the most important healing places at ancient times. Apart from the area of Asklipieion, you can also visit the ancient theatre of Epidaurus and the nearby museum. Lastly, you can visit one of Greece’s most picturesque town of Nafplio. Finally, marvel at the Palamidi castle or wander through the cobbled alleys and admire the architecture. All in all, no other city in the world is as endowed with history and culture as these tiny little jewels of Athens.</p>
      <p>A little less than 2 hours away from Athens, there are hourly bus services that should serve you right. Other than that, there are rental car options, equally feasible.
      </p><br>
      <h5>4. Corfu</h5>
      <p>
        No other Mediterranean destination has managed to encompass a history so rich, and a land as beautiful as this one! Corfu, a much frequented Greek island in the Ionian Sea, is the second largest of the Islands and forms a major chunk of territorial Greece. Bound up with the legends of Greece from the beginnings of Greek mythology, with the fables and stories being loaded in innumerous battles and conquests, Corfu often manages to overtake Santorini and Mykonos in terms of popularity. St George South to the west boasts the largest sandy beach on the island, coupled with a selection of all inclusive package hotels and traditional villas and flats. Its picturesque Korission Lake Nature Reserve is a haven for bird watchers and photographers. You can travel to Corfu from Athens by a plane ride. It is recommended to book your plane ticket well in advance to get a good price. The plane ride takes 2 hours and 45 minutes to complete and is available everyday.

      <p>
        The largest town on the island, Fira is one of the most picturesque spots in the entirety of Greece. Along with the blessing of an enchanting view, Fira is also the epicentre of many restaurants, antiquity and colloquial shops as well as hotels providing the perfect place for accommodation in Santorini. If you are also looking for nightlife in your vacation, Fira plays the epicentre of the nightclubs in Santorini. However, if your definition includes peace and solitude as an integral part, then it might not serve as the best choice.

      <h5>2. Imerovigli</h5>
      <p>
        Located on the higher end of the hill, this place is known for its phenomenal sights of the sunsets. One of the quietest towns in Santorini, this place is one that inspires inspiration. Though not a very big attraction on the restaurant front, but the ones in the vicinity are all in the strata from good to great. The proximity to Fira and Firostefani also solves the other requirements of human indulgence. So if you want to take a step back from humanity and enjoy nature, this is the perfect place to live.

      <h5>3. Oia</h5>
      <p>
        Home to some of the best hotels in Santorini, Oia is counted as the most romantic town in the vicinity. Replete with captivating sunsets and a bustling neighbourhood in Santorini, this is said to be the best stay for your honeymoon. The restaurants in the area also top the lists of Santorini, though the nightlife of the place lacks some color and vibe. The walk from Oia to Fira is enthralling but is a bit long and people generally prefer to drive instead. That being said, this is one of the most sought after locations by couples visiting the place.
