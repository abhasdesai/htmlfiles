      <h5>Day 3 – Day trip options</h5>
      <h5>
        The rugged, wild mystique of Icelandic capital, Reykjavik charms both locals and travelers alike. There is so much beauty everywhere you look in and around Reykjavik that it’s impossible to go wrong no matter what you choose. Glaciers, waterfalls, volcanoes, lagoons, it’s like a whole schmear in one territory! And cherry on top is the city’s art and culture scene, architectural marvel and slurpy culinary tradition.
        And with all this comes the beyond gorgeous neighboring attractions around Reykjavik, that need not more than a day to be unraveled. So as you travel across this side of Scandinavia, don’t miss out on the best day trips from Reykjavik. Here goes:
      </h5><br>

      <h5>1. Blue Lagoon</h5>
      <p>
        The most natural and rejuvenating natural spa, Blue Lagoon is the world’s greatest geothermal seawater, known for its skin enrichment effects. Located in a small town of Grindavik, stationed close to Reykjavik, Blue Lagoon lets you soak in splendid vistas of nature as you dip yourself in the energizing silica mud. So lose yourself in the geothermal waters, followed by a nice cold water shower and then an exhilarating neck and shoulder massage under the waterfall! This place is the best pick to give your vacay a relaxing end.
        Many buses commute between Reykjavik and Blue Lagoon at regular intervals. But the best way to be there is by car, which takes about an hour to reach the destination.
        </p><br>
      <h5>2. The Golden Circle</h5>
      <p>
        Another very popular day trip from Reykjavik, The Golden Circle boasts a myriad of places to unwind. The ‘Volcano Zone’ of Iceland, this part of the south coast is a vastly celebrated natural wonder, which also serves as an excellent energy provider to the islanders in producing sustainable energy. Talk about the breathtaking Gullfoss Waterfall, Strokkur Waterspout and bubbling pools at Geysir or the spectacular tectonic rift at Thingvellir National Park- everything is a rare adventure in the Golden Circle! Looks like too much work but this entire loop can easily be traversed in a day’s time, thanks to the close proximity to Reykjavik.
        Getting to the Golden Circle from Reykjavik is equal parts easy and exciting. You can rent anything from a bike to a Super Jeep, or take a bus up there.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Snaefellsnes Peninsula</h5>
      <p>
        This is the most frequented part of western Iceland, with Snæfellsjökull being the main highlight of the area. Plenteous lava caves, shiny golden beaches, plummeting seaside cliifs, sparkling waterfalls and hot springs reside in this peninsula along with a gigantic volcanic glacier. Also nicknamed as ‘Iceland in Miniature’, it encompasses most of the country’s assets in its 100 km stretch. Surreal landscapes with autumn leaves and green moss covering the lava fields look like a painting.
        You can take one of the many buses commuting between Reykjavik and Snaefellsnes Peninsula that get you here in not more than 2 hours. Car ride is another easy option.
      </p><br>
      <h5>4. Grimsey Island</h5>
      <p>
        Home to a hundred people living in harmony with a million seabirds, this bustling fishing hub is a jewel of Northern Iceland. Being a mecca for wildlife freaks, you might be lucky enough to encounter a polar bear that may drift from Greenland on rare occasions! Puffins, gorgeous little birds reside in maximum capacity here. And with millions of birds come zillions of eggs. So for eggitarians, this atoll is an absolute heaven!
        You can ride on ferries and boats to reach the island.
      </p><br>
      <h5>5. Hvita</h5>
      <p>
        For hardcore adventurers who seek a spine-tickling thrill while vacaying in Reykjavik, the river rafting experience in the gorgeous Hvita river is inevitable! Flowing along the Glacier Langjokull, Hvita continues to eventually fall as the majestic Gullfoss waterfall. It cuts smoothly through serene canyons, while occasionally producing insane rapids and waves. At the end of it, you return to the base camp to indulge in a nice sauna while sipping in the picturesque vistas.
        An hour’s journey from Reykjavik, you can reach the banks og Hvita by bus or drive all by yourself!

      <h4>Best places to party in Reykjavik</h4>
      <p>
        Travelers often get misled by the secluded and quiet capital of Iceland, but Reykjavik knows it well how to raise the roof for party and carousal! Cafes and bars here pose a Jekyll & Hyde character, both serve beer and coffee all day long, before they turn the buzz on and convert into dancing floors!
        So if you are wondering why tourists and travel magazines are going gaga over the nightlife in Reykjavik (or Jammith as the locals say), check out these top 3 places to party in Reykjavik:
      </p></br>
      <h5>1. Laugavegur</h5>
      <p>
        The commercial artery of downtown Reykjavik dresses up to party after dusk, when bacchanals replace the shoppers and coffee drinkers turn into boozehounds. Kaffibarinn, Reykjavik’s coolest club, an old house with a London Underground symbol over the door, is mostly packed to capacity with musicians and hippies. For queens, there Kiki, an ostensible place to shake your booty on pop and electronica. The sweeping Mediterranean style décor and an outdoor patio at Café Oliver makes it another hot destination for party hunters.
       </p><br>
      <h5>2. Hverfisgata</h5>
      <p>
        This street runs parallel to the main street of Laugavegur. Earlier a ghetto to this geothermal capital, Hverfisgata has now smartened up after its facelift with trendy restros and shopping arenas. Celtic Cross, the Irish pub that brings you multiple beers on tap is ideal for game watchers, thanks to its big TV screen. Then there is Bar 101, posing a snob factor with its wealthiest jet set clientele. Hverfisbarinn is a haven for weekday partiers who are too much into live music; the place goes insane on Thursdays from 9pm to 11.30pm! Bar 11, another insanely popular rock playing, old-school bikers’ bar is ideal for people who aren’t much into dressing up or dancing.
      </p><br>

      <h5>3. Austurstraeti</h5>
      <p>
        Austurstraeti is another trending shopping and nightlife location in Reykjavik. Earlier a ‘back street’, Austurstraeti turned the limelight to itself only a few decades back. The place is replete with clubs and bars, but Austur outstands them all with its international charm and gorgeous interiors. It’s a party place for fancy pants who love to party in style. Then there’s American Bar, typical to its name with students partying on the latest MTV tunes. For veteran tasters, The English Pub offers over 35 brands of Whiskey and Beer, along with a bunch of big screens and TVs to grab a Soccer match.

      <h4>Best places to stay in Reykjavik</h4>
      <p>
        Reykjavik, a quaint small town clung to the corner of a largely uninhabited island, is as beautiful as the people living in it. Experiencing a tourism boom off late, the Icelandic capital has upgraded a lot in terms of accommodation and facilities.
        So if you are wondering where to stay in Reykjavik, here is a list of the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in the city:
      </p></br>
      <h5>1. Midborg</h5>
      <p>
        Icelanders have a habit of identifying neighborhoods with their postal codes, and 101 stands for the downtown, or Midborg. People seeking a stay in the heart of the city and in close proximity to the main touristy spots should base themselves here. Downtown Reykjavik is vibrant and vivacious with a lot of cafes, eateries, brand stores, museum and galleries keeping it tied up. But all this comes with a price; it’s hard to locate a pocket-friendly hotel in this area. Visit the Hallgrimskirkja Church, the Harpa Conference Hall and the lovely Tjornin (City Lake). Weekends in this neighborhood are often loud and boisterous, thanks to the raving Reykjavik nightlife concentrated mostly around Laugavedur, downtown’s main street.
       </p><br>
      <h5>2. Laugardalur</h5>
      <p>
        The eastern end of the city is all about cafes, restaurants and recreational activities. Laugardalur has a multi-faced personality with residences and businesses flourishing exponentially in a locality that has dedicated geo-thermal pools. It may not be as hip as the downtown, but a slew of family-themed attractions makes it a hit among group travelers. Take your little ones to the Reykjavik Zoo, Botanical Gardens and Laugardalsvallur Stadium. The hot pool complexes offer a perfect haven after a long day of foot-exploration of this tiny atoll. It rests on one end of Laugavedur, the hustling main street of Reykjavik; so you are stationed in close proximity to a lot of action!
      </p><br>

      <h5>3. Vesturbaer</h5>
      <p>
        To the west of the city centre is a rather quiet and vastly upscale neighborhood of Vesturbaer. The area has sea on both sides, which makes it a lot more picturesque than other localities. Major tourists aren’t much around here; National Museum of Iceland and the University of Iceland campus are on the eastern edge, while the Marine Museum is on the northern fringe. Vesturbaejarlaug, Reykjavik’s most famous geo-thermal pool lies in this area. Connectivity by buses is limited, so it’s better to walk to the main area. Rent a bike and you will reach downtown within 10-15 minutes!

      <h5>Day 4</h5>
      <p>
        Leave for Akureyri by a bus ride or a plane ride. It is recommended to book which ever option you choose, well ahead of time to get a good price. A plane ride would take 45 minutes to complete and is available throughout the week. A bus ride would take around 6 hours and 30 minutes to complete and is available twice every day. You can also choose to rent a car and drive up to Akureyri which would take you around 4 hours and 30 minutes to reach.
