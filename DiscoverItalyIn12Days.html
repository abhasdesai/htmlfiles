      <h5>Day 3 - Day trip options</h5>
      <p>
        Italy's hot-blooded capital, Rome is considered one of the most romantic and inspiring cities across the planet. A unique mix of the hauntingly beautiful ruins and the awe-inspiring arts along with the vibrant streets, this place gives a new definition of inflatus to the world. With a wide plethora of attractions including Colosseum, Roman Forum and Pantheon, it can be pretty hard to tear yourself from the city. However for the proper Lazio region, a venture to the wonderful hosts of historic and natural sites around is essential.
        Complete with the cultural roots binding the tourists to the premises, here are some of the best day trips from Rome:
      </p><br>
      <h5>1. Pompeii</h5>
      <p>
        Considered as one of the most elemental day trips from Rome, Pompeii is the most compelling archaeological site in Europe. A stark reminder of the malign forces deep inside Vesuvius, Pompeii can be best experienced by taking a guided tour or audio tour, walking among the streets of this ruined metropolis to learn about its history and see what remains of 2,000 year old shops, restaurants, residential homes, baths and brothels as well as political, religious and commercial centres.
        One of the best ways for the commutation is the bus, taking 2 hour for the commutation. Other ways to travel from Rome to Pompeii would be to take a cab or drive the way down to Pompeii in about 2h 44minutes in total.
    </p><br>
      <h5>2. Positano</h5>
      <p>
        Amalfi Coast's most photogenic and expensive town, Positano is one place where you can witness vertiginous houses down to the sea in a cascade of sun-bleached peach, pink and terracotta. The colour in the town is sprinkled around and can be observed on the steep streets and steps, which are flanked by wisteria-draped hotels, smart restaurants and fashionable retailers providing you gifting opportunities for the friends back home. However, beyond the facades of money and fashion you will notice the reassuring signs of everyday reality including crumbling stucco, streaked paintwork and even, on occasion, a faint whiff of drains.
        Located at a distance of 274kms from Rome, the most comfortable and viable journey that people take is through the train taking them 2h 54min. Other viable options for day tours with rental cabs or maybe driving the way taking 3h 43mins of road time.  To make the most out of your sojourn, prefer a drive down the Amalfi; it’s breathtaking!
    </p><br>
      <h5>3. Capri</h5>
      <p>
        The perfect microcosm of Mediterranean appeal, Capri is one place with the fabled beauty and refined hedonism enough to charm people from Roman rules to Hollywood legends. A sight involving the fusion of glittering grottoes and coves, welcome the visitors who spare time for this beauty. Though the place is brimming with designer boutiques and expensive cafes, the unspoilt charm of Capri is still prevalent in the grand villas, overgrown vegetable plots, sun-bleached, peeling stucco and banks of brilliantly coloured bougainvillea
        There are three ways to cover the distance between the two places, the most convenient being the train, taking roughly 3 hours for the journey. Other options for the travel are renting a cab or driving the ways, both taking the road time of 4h 30min for the journey. It is best to begin your journey early morning, so you have enough time to explore the city.
      </p><br>
      <h5>4. Orvieto</h5>
      <p>
        A treat for sore eyes, Orvieto, is perched on a volcanic plug of rocks looking down upon fields streaked with vines, and olive and cypress trees. Complete with the cobbled lanes, medieval piazzas and churches, the place is like a love child of Rome and Florence snuggled between the aforementioned. One of the major attractions of the place is the Duomo, considered as one of Italy’s finest with its stunning mosaics and frescoes. Complete with a labyrinth of 3000 year old underground tunnels, Orvieto's elaborate tunnels contain grandiose rooms, stairs, cisterns and quarries to serve the nobility in the past.
        To cover this distance of 97kms, the best way is to choose the rails, taking a little over an hour for the journey. Other options include buses taking 3 hours and cars taking a little less than 2 hours for commutation.
        </p><br>
        <h5>4. Naples</h5>
        <p>
          Capital of Campania region of Italy, this is one of the best known historical centers of the world and has been recognized as the UNESCO World Heritage Site. There are about 500 monuments and churches in Naples, the highest number for any city in the world. You can visit beautiful castles, churches and museums to understand local history and culture of the region. Besides historical attraction, there are plenty of other activities you can indulge into when in Naples. As part of city tour you can take boat rides in Lake Agnano, go snorkelling in the Gulf of Naples or simply enjoy open air cinema. You can visit Naples by bus or a train ride. A bus ride would take 2 hours and 45 minutes to complete and is available 4 times in a day.

      <h4>Best places to party in Rome</h4>
      <p>
        Rome puts up varied standards for nightlife in Italy, compared to its other sister towns. Of course, bars, pubs, lounges and dance clubs are spread across the city, but the city itself turns into a huge party hall offering infinite fun. With a pleasant weather for most part of the year, every plaza, every square turns into a big outdoor bar. Try a ‘Passeggiata’ (slow walk through the old town) with the locals to see and be seen.
        So know more about the Roman party culture as you unwind the top 3 places to party in Rome:
      </p><br>
      <h5>1. Trastevere</h5>
      <p>
        This hippie neighborhood in Rome is as much Roman as international, with many restaurants, cafes and pubs offering the mandatory aperitif. Being the best nighttime destination in Rome, Trastevere incorporates the bustling Piazza Trilussa, where countless students assemble at the stairs for a tete-a-tete, besides some older clientele filling in the nightclubs around the square. You will spend most of your time scurrying between the chic boutiques and outdoor cafes. Mr. Pucci is an eccentric one-room lounge having quirky furnishings and somewhat bizarre entertainment. Then there is Ma che Siete Venuti a Fa (Meaning What the hell are you doing here!), an amusing football bar.
      </p><br>
      <h5>2. Testaccio</h5>
      <p>
        This area’s major clubbing district rotates around one long, winding street which is home to many Rome’s late-night locales. The nightspots in Testaccio are mostly casual and vibrant, with DJs playing everything from techno, hiphop, house, Indie rock, Tango and R&B. On the Rox is a famous after-party venue for bartenders and night hawks who hit the ground here after everything else closes down. Salotto 42 is an upscale book-bar lounge where intellectuals and politicians gather to talk literature. L’Oasi della Birra is an eminent off-license aperitivo spot, also known as the oasis of Beer, offering countless Roman and international ales.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Campo de Fiori</h5>
      <p>
        Streams of tourists head to the Fiori after dark, when the boho-urban tide of Rome changes direction. The vivacious part of the city houses over 20 bars and restaurants from every stripe. Despite so many options to party in Rome, you will find umpteen partiers flooding the outdoors and bar porches. The party begins here right after dusk and goes on till wee hours in the morning. Drunken Ship is a bar in Rome, well-flocked by British and Americans.

      <h4>Best places to stay in Rome</h4>
      <p>
        For over two millennia, Rome has been a mecca for travelers and historians. Even today, it continues to be as exhilarating as it was centuries back. Enthralling history, exquisite Italian cuisine and an excellent selection of designer boutiques, Rome is every type of traveler’s dream.
        With a towering tourism industry, it is hard to decide which the best place to stay in Rome is. But depending upon your purpose of travel, you can always pick from the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Rome::
      </p><br>

      <h5>1. Centro Storico</h5>
      <p>
        The historic center of Rome, now restored and more beautiful than ever- Centro Storico encompasses the legendary Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona, The Spanish Steps and the Panthoen. For first time visitors, it is the perfect place to base yourself. However, the prices can be aptly bank-breaking. So if you don’t mind splurging on accommodation and food in Rome, try Centro! You can pick one of the Twilight City Strolls that shows you the most breathtaking vistas of the Roman city. The Trevi is beyond magnificent at night; you would love to step out of the hotel room right into the Piazza.
      </p><br>

      <h5>2. Jewish Ghetto</h5>
      <p>
        This intriguing testament to history is tucked in the heart of the city, adjacent to Centro Storico. Crooked streets, cobbled alleys and a lovely old-town feel makes this district quaintly European. Popular attractions like the Jewish Colosseum, Campo de Fiori and Piazza Farnese can be accessed in the blink of an eye. The Great Synagogue and Bocca della Verita can bite your hand off if you lie! If you have a penchant for food, wish to be centrally located but away from the tourist bustle and seek an authentic Roman experience, Jewish Ghetto is the ideal place to stay in Rome.
      </p><br>

      <h5>3. Celio</h5>
      <p>
        With The Colosseum dominating the heart of this neighborhood, Celio stands out to be a quiet residential district in Rome. Home to the most amazing leftovers of history- The Colosseum, The Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum, Celio lets you have a great time-travel experience. In broad daylight, this area could be quite chaotic and noisy, but after dark, you will be thrilled to see the magnificent amphitheater in its full bloom. Options to stay in Celio are limited, so you need to book well in advance to engulf in the suburb Roman feel. If you are already done with the main squares and wish to explore the ancient Roman ruins, Celio is the best place to stay in Rome.

    </p><br>
      <h5>2. Pisa</h5>
      <p>

Stroll in the narrow streets to find out more about this quaint town.

    </p><br>
      <h5>3. Siena</h5>
      <p>
        This small city with a bug personality gives close competition to the authentic charm of Florence.

        You can reach from Florence to Siena in less than an hour by train. Bus it is better to go for a bus, as it gets you right to the heart of the city.
        </p><br>

Located on the hills between Florence and Siena, this region is replete with verdant landscapes and country roads that get you to the offbeat hilltop towns of Italy.

        </p><br>
        <h5>7. Monteriggioni</h5>
        <p>
          Another significant medieval gem successfully treasured and restored, Monteriggioni owes its recognition to Dante’s Divine Comedy. What makes it unique is its collection of exterior walls and fourteen towers on square basis, giving it an entirely different look from the rest of Italian villages.

      <h5>Day 8/Day 9 – Day trip options</h5>
      <p>
        Venice, the most impromptu choice for anyone seeking a nice, romantic honeymoon destination, is unarguably the most visited city of Europe. Age-old bridges, canals, musical gondolas and infinite love- this floating city is undoubtedly a personified fairytale! Millions of tourists stroll through the St. Mark’s Square while unwinding the history of the Doge’s Palace, the Cathedral and the fantastic Clock Tower.
        Surprisingly, Venice offers equally fascinating day trips to the neighboring Italian cities. From the Dolomite Mountains to the city of Verona, there is so much to see that you would always fall short of time on your vacay. So to make the most of your sojourn, mark these best day trips from Venice on your bucket list:
      </p><br>
      <h5>1. Murano, Burano, Torcello</h5>
      <p>
        Vibrant and offbeat islands rule the Venetian Lagoon, offering the most easily accessible day trips from Venice. The closest one is Murano, famous for centuries for its fine glass making. The whole aura of this atoll is so decadent; you wouldn’t feel like leaving! Next comes Burano, an island known for its colorful houses and the epic Lace Museum. Sip in a nice coffee at one of the many cafes lining up the waterfront here. In the end, head up to the largely uninhabited but beautifully maintained Nature Resserve of Torcello.
        Murano is hardly a 10 minute Vaporetto away from Venice. From there, Burano takes another 35 on Vaporetto. Lastly, reach Torcello in 10 minutes tops in the same water bus.
    </p><br>
      <h5>2. Verona</h5>
      <p>
        An incredibly preserved ancient city of Europe, Verona is the best place for a day trip around Venice. Its historical center features a wonderfully maintained Roman arena, where the famous Verona Film festival takes place every summer. Then there are abundant Romanesque churches boasting excellent interiors and architecture. Verona owes its fame to the epic ‘Romeo and Juliet’ by Shakespeare, with Juliet’s House being a top tourist spot in the city. Take up a Wine tour in the neighboring Valpolicella region if you have time; it is right up to Verona’s north.
        A train ride between Venice and Verona takes a little over an hour. Then there are bus and taxi services, taking more or less the same time.
    </p><br>
      <h5>3. Padova</h5>
      <p>
        This walled city east of Venice houses Europe’s oldest Botanical Gardens and Basilica di Sant’Antonio. Its 12th century City Hall building and a picturesque historical center draw hordes of tourists and historians every year.

Its strategic location and amazingly well connected railway system makes it possible to take plenty of day trips to nearby towns and lakes. Hence, we prepared a list of some of them you must visit in case you decide to take these best day trips from Milan:
    </p><br>
    <h5>1. Lake Como</h5>
    <p>
      Tucked away amidst the northern Italian Alps lays this small piece of paradise called Lake Como. Crisp air, pristine sapphire water, and mind-blowing mountain views, it is everything that you have ever imagined in Italy! The picturesque lake’s shoreline is dotted with some postcard worthy villages and exquisite villas, things that have made Lake Como a playground for the powerful and wealthy. The beautiful gardens and impressive cathedrals have continued to inspire many artists and travellers over several decades.

      Located at a distance of about 85 km from Milan, the best option to reach Lake Como is via train from Milan that hardly takes less than an hour to cover the distance. You can even drive by yourself or maybe rent a car that would get you there in 1h 45 m.
    </p><br>
    <h5>2. Turin</h5>
    <p>
      Turin must be one of the Italy’s most underrated cities. Still far away from travellers’ radar, this one is mostly ignored in lieu of other famous destinations such as Rome or Venice. Mostly associated with automobile industry now, this city is where the founder of Fiat built his empire. But, don’t even for a moment think that it has nothing else to offer. It’s a true royal city of Italy and its grandeur can be reflected in several Palaces around the city such as Palazzo Reale, Palazzo Carignano, and then there is La Venaria, Turin’s equivalent of Versailles. Being a part of Italy, it is only given that there are some iconic cafes here and unsurprisingly, Turin has the most number of historic cafes still in operation today where you can taste the literary and revolutionary atmosphere of 19th century! If you are a hardcore chocolate fan, then you absolutely cannot commit the sin of missing out on this city while visiting Italy!

    </p><br>
    <h5>3. Florence</h5>
    <p>
      Though Florence is a major holiday spot and needs more than just a day to explore it, but, even then if you get only a day here, you really shouldn’t miss on the cake! Very few cities are there who are of a tiny size yet are packed with extraordinary places and things to visit and experience! The birthplace of Renaissance, Florence is an utterly romantic, enticing, and a dreamy city where world class art and gourmet cuisine meet to explode in your senses and provide an experience of a kind. The city has several wine producing and family owned farms due to which, drinking wine is not only expected but mandatory! Home to various global fashion brands such as Gucci and narrow streets lined with haute-couture boutiques, it seems as Florence is only getting more stylish and trendy with time. Like fashion here, sky also changes its colour and mood with every sunrise and sunset. With soft hues of pink and calm shades of orange as well as serene blue, even sunsets are more a piece of art here. Florence is not just a city; it’s more of an experience. And, with Milan’s good railway system, you can visit it in just under two hours. However, if you are a wagon freak and wish to cover the distance by road, then make sure to be an early bird and begin your journey early, as cars and taxis take about 3h 45m to get you there.

        </p><br>
      <h5>5.  Sicily</h5>
        <p>
          The biggest island in the Mediterranean, and with a key position, Sicily has a history and viewpoint was not received from its cutting edge parent but rather from its recent outside rulers.
          A day in this heaven of dark blue skies and rich vegetation could incorporate skiing down a snow-muted well of lava, strolling through orange forests, and swimming inside sight of magnificent remains.
