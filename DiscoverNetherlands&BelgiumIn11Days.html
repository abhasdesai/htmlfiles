      <h4>Day 3 and Day 4 - Day trip options</h4>
      <p>
        Playing capital to Belgium and the Brussels Capital Region, Brussels stands out as a historic yet hip, bureaucratic yet bizarre, haughty yet humble town with a blend of cultures to its very roots. Profuse with bustling outdoor markets, a stunning royal palace and more than a dozen fantastic museums setting the scene, with a variety of breweries and shops to ensure nonstop enjoyment, Brussels itself is a place demanding ample time for exploration. However, the trip to the place isn't complete without soaking up the culture present in the vicinity.
        To witness the greatest confluence of culture and nature in the world, here are some of the best one day trips from Brussels that will let you delve into this beautiful side of Europe:
      </p><br>
      <h5>1. Luxembourg City</h5>
      <p>
        Often mistaken for just a destination of banks and EU offices, Luxembourg City is often ticked off the list for its commercial character. However, reality that hits you after entering the place is entirely converse. A city full of weird spaces, tunnels, and surprising nooks to explore, along with splendid museums and a great dining scene, Luxembourg is one of Europe's most scenic capitals. The best time to visit the place is during a weekend with the on-street parking free and the prices of food taking a lunge.
        Lying at a distance of approximately 320kms, complete with beautifully built roads and unparalleled scenery along the way the best way to travel is to drive the way. Other than that, buses and trains frequent every hour from Brussels to Luxembourg.</p>
      <h5>2. Bastogne</h5>
      <p>
        Bastogne is a sleepy little town that would have been unnoticed if it wasn’t for the events that unfolded during the World War II. Bastogne is now synonymous with the Battle of Bulge where American forces heroically battled against Hitler’s last attempt to regain control of the region. Today you will find many Museums, Monuments and Memorials dedicated to the war that attract tourists to this small town. But that is not all that the city offers, you can explore the wilderness of Ardennes and view wildlife of the region. You’ll also come across beautiful rivers, lakes and springs.
      </p>
      <h5>3. Maastricht</h5>
      <p>
        Considered a true melting pot, in lieu of its location at a distance of just a few miles from Germany and Belgium, Maastricht is one of the most beautiful in the list. Another one of the culturally rich burghals, replete with Spanish and Roman ruins, sophisticated food and drink, French and Belgian twists in the architecture, a shrugging off of the shackles of Dutch restraint, Maastricht is a lively and energetic place, with appeal and allure out of proportion to its size. While strolling around the city, some of the must visit places include: The Markt and the Vrijthof. Another major attraction in the place is the Saint Pietersberg Caves.
Again, with three ways of commutation, there is the option of train taking around 3 hours. Other ways include driving or taking a bus covering the same in 3hr 30minutes.
        </p>
      <h5>4. Dinant</h5>
      <p>
        To the southwest corner of Belgium lies this French speaking region of Wallonia called Dinant. Perched on the banks of River Meusse, with the Citadel of Dinant as the main attraction, the city offers sweeping vistas from atop its cliff, rising arrogantly over the river and the gorgeous city landscapes. To reach up to the Citadel, wear your best shoes, or simply take the cable car if trekking iis not your dope.
You can reach Dinant by Euro Rail, or hire a bus. Driving your way through is another viable option, which takes about 1 hour 10 minutes to reach.

      <h4>Best places to party in Brussels</h4>
      <p>
        The neighboring superstars- Paris and Amsterdam steal a lot of limelight from the overshadowed Brussels, but true wanderlusts know how great a place it is! Located almost in the heart of Europe, this Belgian city is a magnet for first-rate musicians and budding artists.
        Nightlife in Brussels was, for most part, dominated by Irish pubs and bars, with nightclubs mushrooming recently. So try these top 3 places to party in Brussels while traveling through Belgium:
      </p><br>
      <h5>1. Manneken Pis</h5>
      <p>
        ‘Little Man Pee is a legendary bronze statuette, one of the many fountains in Brussels. During festivities, this naked little boy peeing in the fountain is dressed in vibrant attires. Located in the heart of Brussels near the Town Hall, Manneken Pis is close to the Central Station. Popular attractions in Brussels are nearby too such as Grand Place, La Bourse besides many Belgian Chocolates and Waffles selling shops. Celtica is an extremely popular bar among backpackers and students. The Big Game Brussels, a not-so-old Sports Bar serves you the longest Happy Hours in its 2 storey building powered by a beautiful terrace. Les Brasseurs de la Grand Place is another centrally located brewery serving excellent Belgian Beers.
      </p><br>
      <h5>2. Place de St. Gery</h5>
      <p>
        The Place Saint Grey is an old, historic square that serves as a superb nightlife space for punters and partiers. Hardly a 5 minute walk from La Bourse, the piazza serves s an ideal place to relax, meet your friends over lunch on a terrace, watch posers kissing in the air while seeing the sun set. Then after dark, it turns the volume and heat on for night owls seeking some debauchery and hedonism. Joints like Mapa Mundi, Zebra, Le Roi des Belge to name a few, are great places to grab a beer and engage in small talk with locals and tourists.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Marolles</h5>
      <p>
        To the south of Brussels City Centre is this beautiful, ancient district of Marolles. Despite being a working class area, Marolles boasts a quirky bohemian vibe, thanks to the Marolles Market. There is a Roman Catholic Church here, with the district’s main highlight being the main square Place du Jeu du Balle. It serves many passionate antique collectors and art buffs, and becomes home to nightlife hunters at late hours. La Fuse, the most popular nightclub of Brussels rests in Marolles. La Brocante is another generously spaced traditional bar of Brussels. For hipsters and artsies, there is Chaff!
        </p><br>
      <p>
        Brussels is as valuable to the quiet drinkers and Irish pub fans as to the loud party seekers. The city is highly affordable, compared to its neighbors, albeit there is no compromise in the quality of life here.

      <p>
        Choosing where to stay while on a vacation is the most important decision for travel bugs. More than a place to sleep, hotels are your temporary homes during your trip. So choose the best place to stay in Rotterdam wisely, so your vacay becomes all the more memorable.

          Take a step back into the Dutch history with a simple excursion to the Zaanse Schans, located 20 minutes from Amsterdam in the city of Zaanstad.  A living outdoor museum containing a wide variety of collection of historic windmills and also holding various demonstrations such as cheese-processing, coffee-grinding and clog-making, Zaanse Schans is one of the best places on the list. Sit down and eat the deliciously wonderful pancakes in an authentic Dutch restaurant. Zaanse Schans is also the best place to buy souvenirs like cheeses, clogs and miniature Zaanse houses. The best experience that the place has to offer to you is thitse scenic ferry ride.
          Placed at a distance of 21kms from Amsterdam, one of the most preferred options is to hire a car and drive the way costing you barely half an hour. Other options involve taking a bus taking around 40 minutes for the same commutation.

        <h5>3.  Giethoorn</h5>
        <p>
          Boats and bikes are what define the jaw-dropping beautiful Nether village of Giethoorn. Rightfully nicknamed as the ‘Venice of the North’ or the ‘Village with no roads’, this village is too cute for words! Infinite canal cruises and vendors rent you boats. But whether you rent one or take a tour, DO NOT miss this omnipresent ride. The best thing about this day tour would be- you do not have to run here and there to explore touristy spots. The whole village is a giant tourist attraction! You may actually get tired of clicking photographs; everything is so picturesque here!
          Take a train from Amsterdam to save time and reach Giethoorn in 2.25 hours.
        </p></br>
        <h5>4.  Volendam</h5>
        <p>
          A bustling harbour replete with colourful boats and an authentic Dutch heritage lays just a 30 minute travel away, towards the north of Amsterdam in Volendam. A former fishing port turned into an unashamedly tacky tourist trap, Volendam today is certainly a quaint little place, boasting its rows of wooden houses and locals who don traditional dresses for church and festive events. With the harbour awash with kitschy souvenir shops, dress-up-in-Dutch-traditional-costume photo booths, a virtual-reality walk through old Volendam a walk down the small lanes, will get you an insight into the Dutch culture you wouldn't have before. To reach Volendam, there are two choices including a bus ride with the travelling time of 45 minutes and driving the way, taking around half an hour for the same journey.
