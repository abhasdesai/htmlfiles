This city is one filled with after sun activities, catering to the large student population.

      <h5>2. Cascais</h5>
      <p>
        A summertime playground, Cascais has rocketed from a laid-back and sleepy fishing village to a much-loved summertime tourist destination for the travel bugs. Though mainly renowned for its beautiful beach life, its post- beach culture is just as happening, featuring a maze of cobbled lanes leading to quaint museums, beautiful gardens, a rushed marina and a pedestrianised old town dotted with designer boutiques and alfresco fish restaurants. After the sun is set, there are a number of things you can witness in the place with the lively bars constantly fuelling the party.
One of the fastest methods of commutation is a car or cab, taking 40-45 minutes of travel time. Another way to travel from Lisbon to Cascais would be taking a bus, costing you 1h and 30min.
        </p>
      <br>
      <h5>3. Obido</h5>
      <p>
        A meander of cobblestoned streets and gorgeous flower-bedecked, whitewashed houses livened up with dashes of vivid yellow and blue paint, Obidos boasts a medieval puzzle of culture and traditions, bringing you the heart and soul of authentic Europa. One of the most delightful places to spend the day around Lisbon, you will catch beguiling sights of the village from panoramic hilltop castles. The main street of the town, thanks you its popularity, are ridiculously touristy, especially on weekends and during festivals.

        One preferred mode of transport by most tourists is the bus, costing you 2h 15 min of journey time. Other options include cabs and driving the way taking a little over an hour.</p><br>
