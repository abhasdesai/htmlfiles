      <h4>Best places to party in Barcelona</h4>
      <h5>1. Gothic Quarters</h5>
      <p>
        Barrio Gotico’s narrow streets are a god sent site for nightowls and hardcore partiers. Hosting the wildest bars in Barcelona, the Gothic Quarters showcase it all from the live jazz bars to noisy indie discotheques. Macarena, a shoebox sized techno club is at a stone’s throw from the legendary Las Ramblas. Sidecar (See-de-car) and Karma are eminent rock and indie clubs that stand with pride at Plaza Reial. For Latin, Funk and Soul listeners, there is the Marula Café in City Center. Hip hoppers head to the Afro-American Jamboree, while opulent cocktail drinkers assemble at Los Alamos.
      </p><br>
      <h5>2. Port Olimpic</h5>
      <p>
        This up and coming district in Barcelona turns into a 24/7 party place in the summer months. The infinite stretch of upscale restros and nightclubs draws many smarty pants to grab a fancy cocktail. Places like CDLC (Carpe Diem Lounge Club), Ice Bar, Shoko and of course the epic Opium Barcelona (the one with a superb restaurant on a beach-side terrace) are some of the most popular nightspots in Barcelona. Cool cats in swanky beachwear and ritzy sunglasses drop by in abundance here for evening booze, before the dolled-up damsels and gorgeous Adonises try their luck with an after-party hook-up until wee hours.
      </p><br>

      <h4>Best places to stay in Barcelona</h4>
      <p>
        Lively and colorful Barcelona faces the Mediterranean Sea and features the world's top city beaches, including Sant Sebastià, Barceloneta and Somorrostro beaches. The city sets the template for urban style, hip design and sheer nonstop energy. 
        The city’s popularity means finding a hotel vacancy at any time of year can be difficult, so it’s always best to book in advance. There’s a wide range of options, though, from youth hostels and budget pensions to glam five-star-plus hotels, housed in medieval mansions and Modernist masterpieces alike.
    </p><br>
      <h5>1. Gothic Quarter</h5>
      <p>
        Gothic Quarter is the most central area of Barcelona and very well connected to everything. It is one of the city’s most touristic areas. There are world-class shops and museums only steps away. Food wise, it’s not the best neighborhood but there are some diamonds in the rough. The main avenue of the Gothic Quarter is called Les Rambles (Las Ramblas), and it’s surrounded by luxury hotels and hostels alike. Honestly, I wouldn’t skimp if deciding to stay in this part of town. You’ll get what you pay for. If trying to save, you might consider a guest apartment, which is a great choice when traveling as a family!
      </p><br>
      <h5>2. El Born</h5>
      <p>
        El Born is perfect for anyone looking to be in the heart of Barcelona, the beach, the Gothic Quarter and Several metro stops that connect you to rest of the major stops. This neighborhood is perfect for exploring little local shops full of amazing products from handmade ceramics to custom leather aprons (which every trendy restaurant seems to have their waiters wear!) to art galleries. The alleyways are filled with street art, especially la bomba (the bomb), which represents Barcelona’s anarchist spirit, and flags and buntings for the perfect photo opportunities.
      </p><br>
      <h5>3. Barcelenota:</h5>
      <p>
        The most preferred neighborhood for beach lovers, but suffers with the utmost backlash for tourism by the locals. Nevertheless, you can stay here if you respect the locals. That means that when you leave the beach put on some clothes before you pop into a shop or grabs a bite to eat. If you are out until the early hours of the morning (which happens easily here), keep your voices down to avoid disturbing people who are asleep. Take a stroll along the sand and notice all the locals out walking, rollerblading, biking, and soaking up the Mediterranean sun. Barceloneta will treat you well if you treat it well.

    <h4>Day 19 - Day trip option/continue exploring Seville</h4>
    <h5>Ronda</h5>
    <p>
      One of the typical White Villages of Spain, Ronda boasts a jaw-dropping gorge, quaint homes and panoramic vistas of a lush countryside. Built astride a deep ravine with beautiful bridges joining the two sides, Ronda is the most famous one of the Pueblos Blancos (White Villages). The place is ideal for low-key travelers and peace-seekers who wish to do nothing beyond strolling around and eating a lot.
      Ronda is a 2.5 hour bus journey from Seville, and about 2 hours if you drive yourself. Rail connectivity is seldom met with.
      </p>
    <h5>Cordoba</h5>
    <p>
      The great Moorish history of Cordoba is hard to unwind in a day, but you can make it if you begin your sojourn early. History of a long-gone empire, elegant cityscapes and convivial plazas make Cordoba a great destination for day-trippers. The Mezquita is the first on the list, with Cordoba’s own Alcazar just down the street from Mezquita. The legendary Roman Bridge and its nearby streets are a mandate, as are the city’s recently explored Arab Baths. Try a Scavenger Hunt in any of the residential patios; they offer beautiful flowery retreats with homeowners always ready to welcome!
      Cordoba is a 45 minute ride from Seville by the superfast train. Then there are bus and car options that take 2h 15m to reach.
    </p>
    <h5>Cadiz</h5>
    <p>
      This one’s a combination day tour; Cadiz lets you bask in the Spanish sun after you are done with the sightseeing and exploration. The town’s main piazza, the adjoining Cathedral, as well as the Roman amphitheater are typical of a European sojourn. Visit the Falla Theater, Plaza Espana, Santa Catalina and San Sebastian castles while you are here. When done with all this, head on to the Royal Prison and the beach to relieve for the day at a beach bar.
      Seville to Cadiz takes an hour and a half by trains and 1.45 hours by bus. But if you are really time crunched, go for a car ride that would get you there in 1.15 hours.
      </p>
    <h5>4. Jerez de la Frontera</h5>
    <p>
      Find the wonderful sherry-producing town of Jerez de la Frontera, the equestrian capital of Spain. Sherry is one of the oldest wines in the world and draws millions of wine tasters to its fields. The winding streets of this old village and the 11th century Alcazar are eminent tourist spots.
      Jerez is hardly an hour ride from Seville. Bus takes a little over an hour, and car just the same.

    </p><br>

    <p>
      Despite the historical pomp, these are two popular destinations for nightlife in Seville. If you head into these less touristy areas of the town, you'll find broad, tree-lined avenues circumscribed by lots of bars, gastro pubs, live music venues, avant-garde cafes with outdoor terraces, dance clubs, and a lively punk and boho-hipster scene. Nearby is Calle Feria, just east of the Alameda. Here you’ll find a gastronomic market that hosts weekend concerts.
      </p><br>
    <p>
      Whether you’re looking for craft cocktails, decadent desserts, tapas bars and weekend flamenco shows, or a night spent getting sweaty dancing under the stars, Seville has a great deal of options. Hand-pick your favourite of these three places to party in Seville.

    <h4>Best places to stay in Seville</h4>
    <p>
      Seville is often called a doorway to the past. With much of the city built during the Moorish ties, there is much to see including the 18th-century bullring and the site of Christopher Columbus’s tomb. It is also the hottest major metropolitan area in the Western Europe. Despite being drenched in spirit-enriching sunlight for most of the year, Seville is drop-dead spectacular. Stroll through the toasted boulevards, traverse exotic palaces and museums swamped with history or lose yourself in the narrow, twisted streets in the city's old quarters, dance flamenco and devour the best tapas in the world.
Here’s a rundown of the different neighborhoods to help you plan the best place to stay- for you! Choose from the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Seville, here:
  </p><br>
    <h5>1. The Alameda District</h5>
    <p>
      Home to trendy bars, vegetarian restaurants, and all-in-one bar-gallery-stores, Alameda is perfect for family holidays. There are various buildings of note in this area including the Convento Santa Clara, the Torre de Don Fadrique and the Convento San Clemente. It also houses an arts centre, couple of children playgrounds, trendy eateries and happening night spots.
    </p><br>
    <h5>2. Santa Cruz</h5>
    <p>
      Santa Cruz is the primary tourist district of Seville. It is a sacred haven for tourists who come in search of the true essence of Seville, or even Spain, because of the intrinsic charm, beauty and atmosphere of the area. It is the location of many of Seville's oldest churches and a high concentration of gorgeous boutique hotels. It is home to the Cathedral of Seville and the Calle Juderia, which is possibly the most picturesque street in Seville.
    </p><br>
    <h5>3. Triana</h5>
    <p>
      If you are looking for an honest-to-goodness holiday in sun, then this is the best location for you to stay in Seville. This neighborhood of Seville is originally located outside the main city and hence has a village feel to it. It has lots of little shops and local markets. If you are hooked on Tapas, you’ll find yourself in Triana. One of the most popular spot here for after hours is Calle Betis, along the water front in Triana. It’s best to walk down the street to cool off by the river and choose from the large number of bars.
