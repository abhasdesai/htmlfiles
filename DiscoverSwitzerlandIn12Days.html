Emerging as the most hip destination in the entirety of Europe, Zurich is counted as the largest and wealthiest metropolis of Switzerland. Complete with its post-industrial artsy edge, the place is epitomised in its exuberant summer Street Parade.

A mountain in Switzerland (1,115 meters above sea-level) located partially along the shore of Lake Lucerne, the most redeeming quality of this peak amongst its competitors is that it houses Europe's tallest outdoor lift: the Hammetschwand Lift. It connects the beautiful cliff path with the vantage point, from where extensive views of Lake Lucerne and the surrounding mountains are to be had. The only lagging point is its availability; it runs mid-May - mid-October only!
          To reach this mountain top, you need to take the shuttle boat to Kehrsiten-Bürgenstock, followed by a Funicular that gets you right to the top! This entire sojourn takes about 45 minutes of travel time.

People throng to this Alpine resort for the sheer beauty of the natural landscape as well as for the wide variety of holiday activities provided for every kind of visitors.
