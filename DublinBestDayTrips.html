		<h5>Best Day trips from Dublin</h5>

		<p>A mix of heritage and hedonism, Dublin is renowned for its vibrancy, nightlife and tourist attractions, despite having a scanty number of square kilometeres in its account. The history of Dublin involves the accolade of British Empire’s Second City, honouring the country with the diversity and multiculturalism prevalent in its veins today. However if your trip to this amazing place is constricted with time and you don't wish to miss on the beauty, we are here to your aid.
Following is a rundown of the best day trips from Dublin to some of the most spectacular pieces of nature and culture that Ireland has to offer:

<h5>1.	Giant's Causeway</h5>
<p>
  One of the best geological marvels, Giant Causeway, has been referred as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and portrays the capital’s conflicted history wrapped in the arms of heritage. Located on the North-east of the County Antrim in Belfast, this place is well steeped in legends and myths. To reach the cliff top here, you can take one of the four trails that lead you to stunning vistas and magnificent seascapes from up there. Another attraction on the trip would be the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge, a connecting bridge between the mainland and the tiny island of Carrickarede. Replete with aesthetic headlands famous for shooting of Game of Thrones, this is one place you just can't check out of your list. So for people who are easily charmed by geological antiquities, rugged cliffs and secluded bays, Giant Causeway renders the perfect heaven!
You can take one of the many trains that take 2 hours to get you from Dublin to Belfast. Even a road trip would be ideal if you wish to enjoy Irish beauty at its best. From there, it is another hour’s drive to Giant Causeway.

<h5>2.	Cliffs of Moher</h5>
<p>
  To escape the bustle of the cosmopolitan life-style, this is the perfect day-out trip from Dublin. Cliffs of Moher are a premier tourist spot, just south to the village of Doolin. Once there, you can simply spend your day strolling on rugged coastal paths offering you insight into the geology and history of the beautiful area from your guide while spending time in the exquisite Burren National Park. On a clear, sunny day, you can gawk at the Aran Islands in Galway Bay and Valleys of Connemara from afar.
As you catch the train from Dublin to Doolin, you get to admire the unparalleled beauty of the countryside containing the dramatic array of cliffs. However, it is better to hit the road to save time; you will reach the village in about 3 hours.
