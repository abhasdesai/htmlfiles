So while you are in the heavenly Scandinavia, check out the top 3 places to party in Dublin:
</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	Temple Bar Area</h5>
		<p>The South Bank of river Liffey holds maximum action of the 24/7 party city of Dublin. Temple Bar Area guarantees a weekend overflowing with booze, party and music. As the evening wears, music goes louder and booze costlier. Auld Dubliner is a great place to drink while listening to live music. Then there is Farrington’s Bar set in a quaint Victorian era building. For Beer lovers, there is Porterhouse for its excellent collection of Irish brews. On Sunday evenings, locals and travelers flock to The Foggy Dew, an authentic bar with a great blend of punters. And if you are seeking more style and sophistication, try The Morgan.

<h5>2.	O’Connell Street Area</h5>
		<p>Located in the heart of the city, O’Connell Street is the most monumental of all the commercial streets in Dublin. This large boulevard is unavoidable with such amazing shopping avenues and hotels. Murray’s, the traditional Irish pub, offers impeccable Irish booze coupled with live music and Irish dances every week, where audiences are welcomed to join in. T.P. Smiths Bar is another great hideaway offering both large and intimate spaces to enjoy a few drinks with your friends. The Arlington hosts you with amazing Irish hospitality that goes on till wee hours.

<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>3.	Camden Street</h5>
		<p>Camden Street is bursting with cafes, bars and independent shops right at your doorstep. The insane Dublin nightlife can be experienced in its full bloom in this neighborhood. The Bleeding Horse is definitely on every traveler’s list, who wishes to explore the city as much after dusk as in the daytime. This 17th century pub was as frequented by literary giants as by regular drinkers. Devitt’s Pub is another great escape for people looking for a Hen Party venue. But very few know of Anseo, a hidden gem surrounded by the Village Quarter, giving it a character offbeat to the Temple Bar Area. Music swings from Afro-beats to Groove, giving some serious adrenaline issues to the laid back visitors.
