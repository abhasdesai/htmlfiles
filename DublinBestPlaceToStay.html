		<h5>Best Place to Stay in Dublin</h5>

So if you are travelling across Ireland and seeking a perfect stay in the 1,000 year old Dublin city, try searching among our insider’s guide to top 3 places for accommodations for a tourist in Dublin:

<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	City Centre North</h5>
		<p>If you wish to be in close proximity to everything the city has to offer, then nothing beats the City Centre. All the main attractions rest in an easy walking distance, be it the shopping area of Grafton Street, the historic Trinity College or the cultural quarter of Temple Bar. General Post Office is one of the many Dublin’s luminaries. Cafes, restaurants and bars line the streets in this locality, besides an impeccable public transport system to connect you to Dublin’s neighborhoods. Take a stroll down the Liffey Boardwalk if you wish to explore the alfresco cafes of the Italian Quarters. However, the neighborhood being noisy even at late hours is quite a fly in the ointment.</p>

<h5>2.	St. Stephen’s Green</h5>
		<p>This lush green locality lies to the South of Trinity College and is linked to it by Grafton Street. Merrion Square rests to the west of it, where beautiful Georgian houses lay iin elegance with Dublin’s iconic doorways. Visit the Leinster House Parliament building if you are a history-buff. The leafy waterfront walks of Grand canal, just west to St. Stephen’s Green are a perfect haven for locals after work. Travelers also fancy Portobello’s well-maintained Victorian-styled, red-brick terraces. As you move further south, the splendid suburbs of Ballsbridge offer many upscale restros and hotels for tourists.</p>
