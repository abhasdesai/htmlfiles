Splendid beaches of the azure sea and informal restaurants make the leisure you dreamt come true, with even celebrities like Beyoncé and Sir Roger Moore considering it their favourite getaway! But despite the infinite offerings this city makes to you, you can’t afford to miss out what’s outside the walls of Dubrovnik.

<h5>1.	Cavtat</h5>
<p>
  Hardly 15 km south of Dubrovnik rests Croatia’s ‘Pearl City’, one that takes you away from the big city hassle of Dubrovnik. Crystal clear turquoise waters, a promenade fringed with palm trees and red-roofed brownstone houses frilling the cobbled streets render it the Croatian license. Sandwiched between a mountainous range and a gorgeous harbour, it houses the Rector’s Palace and the Racic Mausoleum. For art enthusiasts, Cavtat is inescapable, as it is home to the world famous painter Vlaho Bukovac. Boat trips run regularly from Dubrovnik to Cavtat, taking about 40 minutes to get you there. You can even rent a car or taxi if you are time-crunched; it will get you there in less than half an hour.
