<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	Old Town</h5>
		<p>Sleepy all through winters, Dubrovnik wakes up with hope in the hot season, when the Old Town springs to life with its umpteen nightclubs, bars and pubs. Bars in Dubrovnik are quite compact in size. Hip young Croatians mingle with the tourists over a cup of coffee, a glass of wine or a fancy cocktail. The most unique of all is D’Vino Wine Bar, a tiny hideout hidden in a narrow stone alley, boasting exposed stone walls. To try some authentic Croatian booze, visit La Bodega, a 17th century building close to the Rector’s Palace.

<h5>2.	Bay of Lapad</h5>
		<p>Enjoy an opulent evening right by the simmering Adriatic sea in one of the lovely beachside nightlife locations in Dubrovnik. Partiers travel by land and sea to the Lapad Bay to have the dreamiest night outs ever. The main walking strip is lined with cafes, bars and parks. Try a drink inside of a rock at the Cave Bar More, an actual cave with barren stone walls and cutting-edge interiors. Midway through the Lapad Bay strip is Luma Restaurant and Lounge, an open air terrace nestled in the shade of magnolia trees and wild chestnuts. Then there is Coral Beach Club to render you magical vistas of the Daksa Island.

<h5>3.	Copacabana Beach</h5>
		<p>Located below the Babin Kuk settlement of Dubrovnik is this pebble beach with a shallow sea. Besides offering a large number of daytime activities in the waters, Copacabana hosts a vivacious nightlife after sundown. Saturday nights are booked for ‘Beat That Beat’ where DJs from all across the continent come to perform. Moet Parties, Open air Cinemas and impeccable seafood make this beach very popular among tourists.

<p>Bars and Pubs in Dubrovnik mostly cater to standing guests; it’s the best way to strike a conversation or bear the crowded, small joints. Nightlife in Dubrovnik is generally not an all-night affair. Bars and pubs wind up by 1 am, albeit some places function till wee hours in disguise. Overall, this cultural hub of Croatia is way too livelier in the daytime than after dark.</p></div>
