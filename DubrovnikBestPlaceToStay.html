<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	Ploce</h5>
		<p>Ploce Gate- the southern entrance of the Old Town is nestled on the coast, immediately south of the city walls. It is a beautifully sandwiched district between Banje Beach and Sveti Jakov Pebble cove. Frano Supilo Street here houses the most esteemed here, looking over the Lokrum islet. Perched uphill, you get gorgeous vistas of the floodlit Dubrvonik fortifications. Its elegance and close proximity to the old town makes it the perfect place to stay for first time visitors to Dubrovnik. For many, it is a more souped up location than the popular Old Town, as you get to enjoy the medieval town’s attractions and nightlife while staying away from the noise and bustle.</p>

<h5>2.	Lapad Peninsula</h5>
		<p>Cutting-edge waterside hotels, expansive water sports in a sheltered west-facing islet with a pebble beach north-west of the Old Town- Lapad Bay is a great choice for the leisure vacationers who prefer some cultural sightseeing. The place is hardly a 15 minute bus ride from the Old Town. Large number of beaches rest in this area, with the ones stationed deeper in the peninsula being most crowded.

<h5>3.	Gruz</h5>
		<p>Gruz, a busy harbor and yacht marina is locals’ favorite marketplace in Dubrovnik. It lies in close proximity to the islets of Elaphiti, Korcula and Mljet and also serves as the docking area for cruise ships.
