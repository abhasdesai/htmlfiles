		<h5>Best Places to Party in Edinburgh</h5>

		<p>The student-packed capital of Scotland has a host of districts to let you have the wildest of night outs. Nightlife in Edinburgh is at the heart of world culture, especially with the flurry of festivals that go on and on here! Bars and Pubs line almost every street here, offering you every experience from traditional taverns to upbeat stylish bars.
To take a better look at the swanky night scene that fills this picturesque town, visit the top 3 places to party in Edinburgh:
</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	Old Town</h5>
		<p>Circumscribing the student-dominate area of Cowgate is the most historic neighborhood of Edinburgh, the Old Town. The winding Royal Mile of this district is replete with bars, pubs and nightclubs. The ones on Grassmarket, Victoria Street and Candlemaker Road are popular for a reliably raucous vibe, offering a number of live music joints and cheap drinks. Most of the adjoining small alleys and walkways render folk music experiences. Visit Bow Bar if you are a ‘suffer in silence’ type, or Whistle Binkies if throwing shapes on the dance floor is your idea. For party throwers, there is Electric Circus hosting impeccable hen parties. And the ones looking for cheap thrills in loud and sweaty clubs, The Hive offers a labyrinth dance floor.

<h5>2.	Leith</h5>
		<p>The Port of Leith, city’s major harbor is often in news for its eclectic pub culture and sumptuous seafood. It is a gentrified area now, with huge investments making it a up-and-coming district right by the docks. Old Chain Pier, a delightful bar overlooking the sea renders original ales, bottled Craft Beer and cocktails. A personally favored pub right in the heart of Leith is Nobles, a gorgeously restored Victorian-era styled café-bar. Then there is The Village, a vibrant bar with locals playing folk gigs in the back room. Bar hopping is up the charts in Leith, with Swedish-owned joints pulling maximum crowds.

<h5>3.	George Street</h5>
		<p>George Street is an opulent district that lets big pocket-sizes have endless fun. It runs parallel to the Princes Street and is often overlooked by travelers who are focused to reach the Old Town. Beautiful historic mansions with stunning interiors have undergone a facelift with a bar tag on them. Tigerlily offers a great atmosphere with comfortable seating and delicious food, albeit it is said to cater to the richer University students only. Opal, Lulu, Why Not? and Shanghai are the four most crowded venues in the area. Hard Rock Café, a golden oldie hosts a lot of locals and students too.
