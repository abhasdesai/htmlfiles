There is so much beauty in and around the city; shoppers can shop, partiers can party and others can simply relax by the lochs.
So depending upon your purpose of travel, base yourself in the most appropriate district here. Check out the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Edinburgh:
</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	Old Town</h5>
		<p>This is where Edinburgh began. Home to the Edinburgh University and its thousands of students, Old Town offers you immaculate medieval alleys, grand squares and the famous landmarks of Edinburgh Castle, Royal Museum of Scotland and St. Giles’ Cathedral. Major parks like Princes Street Gardens, The Meadows and Holyrood bedeck the grey architecture. A large variety of restaurants, pubs and shopping avenues line the main street of Old Town. Visit the unavoidable Arthur’s Seat and Crags nestled in the Holyrood Park that make you feel like you’ve come to a countryside walk. For travelers, accommodations in Old Town range from classy upscale brands to arty boutique hotels, suiting all pocket-sizes.</p>

<h5>2.	New Town</h5>
		<p>Neo-classical buildings, elegant squares and an appreciable town planning, New Town maintains its authenticity with the streets names after kings and queens. This district of Edinburgh is the most expensive one, with Multrees Walk boasting city’s top designer stores. For punters, there’s George Street, housing the most extravagant nightlife of Edinburgh. For those seeking cheap thrills, there are Rose and Thistle Roads offering excellent bets in economical eateries, pubs and shops. Broughton, the eastern end of New Town is a thriving Gay Quarter with a bohemian feel.</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>3.	Stockbridge</h5>
		<p>Stockbridge is the most appealing neighborhood of Edinburgh having a country-like vibe to it. Situated by the New Town and Comely Bank is this compact zone that is home to quirky shops displaying artisans and local designers. Waters of Leith run across Stockbridge, leaving an enticing Walkway to be strolled through. Plan a picnic at the Royal Botanical Gardens or hit the Brandon Street for a nice coffee. This area is a rather quiet alternative to the bustling New and Old town, sans the loud nightclubs or bustling shopping streets. But you can always hit the George Street, a 10 minute walk from here.
