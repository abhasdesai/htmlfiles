		<h5>1.	Duomo</h5>
		<p>Florence’s bulls eye, The Duomo is for all those planning a short weekend-getaway to Florence. If you wish to be absolutely centrally located, wasting no time in walking to the main touristy spots, and don’t mind splurging on your vacay, then this is just the place to be. Bearing the entire city’s action, Duomo boasts Piazza Della Signoria as its main square. Popular attractions like the Palazzo Vecchio, the Cathedral and Uffizi Gallery will be at a stone’s throw from wherever you base yourself in this neighborhood in Florence. This district is aptly convenient to be connected to other parts of the town, but this also means it is always thriving with tourists.</p>

<h5>2.	Santa Croce</h5>
		<p>If you wish to be centrally located but away from the entire tourist bustle, try Santa Croce. This district in Florence is ideal to give you a local-like feel while keeping in sync with the medieval Florentine art and architecture. Santa Croce offers an impeccable nightlife, upscale shopping avenues and cozy cafes and restaurants, while letting you get sandwiched between the main spots of Oltrarno and Duomo. The area’s main attraction is the massive Basilica, a final resting place for many world-famous Italian artists and thinkers including Galileo and Michelangelo. Don’t miss out on the aperitivo hour to catch up with the locals and get the whole Florentine vibe.</p>
