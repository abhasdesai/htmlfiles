<h5>1.	Espoo</h5>
<p>
  This second largest city in Finland lets you indulge in an overdose of art and culture, besides being a gateway to the Nuuksio National Park, a recently built and highly frequented National Park in Finland. Its 30 km walking and biking trails give you an ideal break from the city chaos, while letting you indulge in adventure. Swimming, camping and hiking are practiced in abundance here in summers, with winters offering skiing and snowshoeing opportunities. A few hours of fishing and berry-picking with the local families are another great way to spend the day.
Being closely stationed to Helsinki, you can reach Espoo in less than an hour. Take a train, bus, taxi, cab or just drive your way through.

<h5>2.	Porvoo</h5>
<p>
  This charming old town district is a rather unexplored UNESCO World Heritage Site and a 14th century fishing port. Replete with idyllic wooden houses, cobbled streets, waterside cafes, craft stalls and quaint little boutiques, Porvoo qualifies for an excellent winter destination, especially around Christmas. Numerous events like concerts and flea markets are profuse in this region, giving a perfect setting to splurge.

<h5>3.	Tallinn</h5>
		<p>
      Tallinn, the Estonian capital, appears to have ripped right out of a fairytale book to the naked eye. From rare antiques to kitsch souvenirs, you will find everything in the labyrinthine boutique shops that seem meagerly stocked on the outside. Hit the high end shops at Viru Keskus or climb up the famous Toompea Temple, this UNESCO World Heritage Listed Old Town creates the perfect aura of a medieval Euro town. The beaches, too, are a great spot for sun-bathing and surfing activities.
A 2.5 hour ferry ride will get you to Tallinn. Other than that, there’s a road trip option, but that would take roughly 3.5 hours to reach Tallinn.
