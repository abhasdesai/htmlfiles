Set on an excursion and discover the hidden Ibiza of provincial towns, farmhouses, sandy beaches and rocky bays in the back of beyond.

		<h5>1.	Ibiza Town</h5>
		<p>
      Ibiza Town is the capital and the largest city on the island and really does have it all. The sheer diversity that this city offers is exceptional. A shopper's paradise awaits you in Ibiza Town, with a great selection of small boutiques and high-end fashion stores. The port area with its buzzing nightlife, the historic old town and clubs like Pacha make this town so popular among the international crowd. A really cheap and fun way to stroll around the island is by joining the regular ferries that will take you from Ibiza port to the beautiful sandy beaches of Talamanca, Figueretas and beyond.

<h5>3.	Santa Eulària des Riu</h5>
		<p>
      Santa Eulalia is the "other side" of Ibiza, lush greenery and unpretentious, heavenly serenity a world away from the frenetic beat of Ibiza Town. This beautiful town on the East coast of the island, is popular with families and those looking for a quieter holiday. It has a long-established reputation as the island's gastronomic and cultural centre, with some of the island's best restaurants and art galleries. A couple of family run hotels, with lush tropical gardens, clean pools, the beautiful and exclusive Yacht Marina ensure that life in Santa Eulalia is led at a rather slower and more relaxing pace..
