		<h5>1.	Altstadt</h5>
		<p>Since all the vigor stay in the center of Innbruck, it is always wise to base yourself in the Old Town (Altstadt), especially if you are traveling across Austria for the first time. A massive baroque Cathedral, a fancy Palace and a bunch of charming squares- all of this magic surrounded in 2000m high mountains. Summers fill the meadows with cows and cowbells, while winters bring a cape of snow over them, both the season being truly magnificent. The Palace of Schloss Ambras, St. Jacob Cathedral, Hofkirche and the tomb of Maxmilan, the Hofburg Museum- there is so much to explore to unwind in this district! But with so much to offer, the accommodations are meant to be pricey.</p>
