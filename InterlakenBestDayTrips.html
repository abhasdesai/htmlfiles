Interlaken, for instance, is a heavenly small town in Central Switzerland, safely nestled amidst soaring mountains and sparkling lakes. Being a treasure trove of holiday delights, Interlaken is a great vantage point for sports activities and chic lakeside resorts. While having so much to boast about, it also lets you take day tours to equally fascinating lands in the vicinity.
So as you traverse through the unparalleled vistas of Swiss, consider taking some of the best day trips from Interlaken:

<h5>2.	Jungfraujoch</h5>
<p>
  A highlight of the Bernese Highlands, Jungfraujoch is a mandatory day trip when visiting Interlaken. It has been the highest Railway Station in Europe for more than a century now. After splurging a good fortune, you get to see the most incredible vistas that are totally worth the effort and price. Get lifted to the peak called ‘Sphinx’ to explore their Observatory and Platform that showcases breathtaking views of Jungfrau, Eiger, Monch and Aletsch Glacier. Further aboard, you can visit the Ice Palace, the Ski and Snowboard Park and the Glacier Restaurant.
To reach Jungfraujoch from Interlaken, book your tickets for Lauterbrunnen and then for Kleine Scheidegg, followed by a Jungfrau Railway that climbs to the Eiger Glacier Station. This takes about 2 hours to reach.

<h5>3.  Gimmelwald</h5>
		<p>
      This small mountain village of Gimmelwald is all about scenic beauty and breathtaking views. With a huge sheer cliff called Black Monk guarding the valley, Gimmelwald features the perfect setting for peace seekers and unhurried travelers. Though, one of the very few underdeveloped villages of Switzerland, the village is richly endowed with postcard-perfect vistas.
To reach Gimmelwald, take a train to Lauterbrunnen, followed by a bus ride to Stechelberg Gondola Station, all in all taking about an hour to reach. Finally, you ride in a gondola all the way to Gimmelwald. You can even rent a taxi or drive yourself, taking the same time to reach. If you feel too fit, you can hike up to Gimmelwald from Stechelberg, gaining a 1.5 hour tete-a-tete with pure, divine nature.

<h5>4.	Lake Thun</h5>

  A mythical chapel set amidst sunny plazas, covered bridges, waterfront promenades and candy-colored houses- Lucerne stands as one of the most stunning Swiss cities you can think of! Set adjacent to a gorgeous cobalt lake that is ringed by the mountain of myth, Lucerne features the cliché, yet scintillating Altstadt (Old Town). Endless music gigs keep the town’s vibe upbeat, thus maintaining the vibrant charm of the ‘City of Lights’.
It takes less than 2 hours to reach Lucerne from Interlaken via rails. A taxi ride, on the other hand, would get you in an hour.
