<h5>1.	Chernobyl</h5>
<p>
  One of the most fascinating tours for the curious ones out there, Chernobyl was a nuclear power point in Ukraine. Remembered mostly for the tragedy that engulfed the entire town about three decades ago and rendered the nearby beautiful town Prypyat in a ghost town now serves as a popular day trip for tourists from Kiev. The worst nuclear tragedy in the world happened when an explosion tore through a reactor because of which the Prypyat had to be evacuated immediately. Now the city still largely abandoned, is populated by a small number of local workers and policemen. Despite such a tragedy and multiple government warnings, there is still an active church called St. Elias Church where devotees are welcomed. Visit the Park of Glory, River Port, and memorial to the liquidators who sacrificed themselves to contain the disaster. In town Prypyat, where an abandoned colourful amusement park lies which was due to open on the day of tragedy, depicts a depressing reality of the aftermath. This is one day trip that everyone should definitely take!
Situated 2 hrs from Kiev, you can reach there through bus or minivans or you can even hire the various tour companies.
