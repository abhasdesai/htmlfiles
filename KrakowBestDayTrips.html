	<h5>Best Day trips from Krakow</h5>


	<p>Krakow, one of the most ancient cities in Poland is the one of the largest too. Having grown significantly from a Stone Age settlement to Poland's second most important city, Krakow flaunts impeccable entertainment opportunities with its theatres, cabarets, clubs and wine cellars. What attracts the most of the travelers here is its historical monuments, recreation, religion and business. Though traditionally been one of the leading centers of Polish academic, cultural, and artistic life, the city is equally awe-inspiring in its castles and Gothic forms of the Polish city of kings.
However, while planning a Polish vacation, it is important to look afar from this well endowed city as well. So check out a few lucrative options to choose from for the best day trips from Krakow:

	<h5>1.	Ojców National Park</h5>
	<p>A place largely occupied by caves, castles and curious limestone cliffs, ravines and rock formations, Ojcow National Park is Poland's smallest national park, but nonetheless ranks among the most attractive recreational areas in the country! For its size, Ojcow houses way too many picturesque and worthy architectural monuments within its limits. After influx, walkers will be able to look into the chunky beech and fir forests and get lost between the needle-like splinters of limestone that make the park so famous. The nucleus of the Ojcow National Park consists of the Pradnik river valley with a road running along it as a spine – most beneficially for the enthusiastic motorists. To much of your surprise, Ojcow village in the park’s heart boasts the odds and ends of the 14th-century castle: Gothic gate, the Octagonal Tower, and ruins of a chapel.
An enjoyable 20 minutes’ ride shall drop you off at Ojcow, whether you choose to traverse it via private cars or taxis.

	<h5>2.	Zakopane</h5>
	<p>Situated in the Tatra Mountains, Zakopane is a resort town, admired by skiers in winter as well as hikers and climbers year-round. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Zakopane evolved into a highly visible art colony, a breeding ground of culture that was ended by the Soviet influence after World War II. Today it lurks backward into a former time, inclusive of its gorgeous wooden houses. You can surely gather more information about these buildings and more at the Museum of Zakopane Style. It might be a self-proclaimed Winter Paradise, but this precious gem of a town is worth a stopover all year round. By summer, it pulses with the vigor of thousands of hikers and bikers, all eager to conquer its trails. In the winter, the snows dusts the cobbled streets, the surrounding pistes offer some of the best skiing experiences. But the main magnet of the Krupowki Street comes to life with the scents of frying sheep’s’ cheese, which is a popular local delicacy.
It is at a distance of a 2 hour journey from Krakow for which you have train and bus services in reach.

	<h5>3.	Kryspinów Lake</h5>
	<p>A well-liked relaxation spot among Krakow-ians, there are two huge bodies of water formed on the site of a sand mine, that constitute the complex. When the humid summers of southern Poland are in their much famous vigor, there’s questionably nowhere better to go and cool off than the waters of Kryspinów Lake. This large basin has everything from well kept beaches to bars, thereby serving travelers with loads of picnic spots, and even a range of heart-pounding water sports in the form of windsurfing and blob jumps. It even comes with all the good wishes you would expect to find in a coastal resort including crystal clear waters, a swimming area complete with slides and a separate play area for younger children. An adventure zone has been added recently which features professional High Rope Courses and events and parties are also thrown in the course of summer.
The Lake is a half an hour ride from Krakow  and can easily be reached by bus.
