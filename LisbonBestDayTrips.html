	<p>Complete with cinematic hillsides overlooking the Rio Tejo, Lisbon is counted as one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. Postcard-perfect panorama of cobbled alleyways, ancient ruins and white-domed cathedrals make Lisbon one of the must visit destinations in Europe. This city is one filled with after sun activities, catering to the large student population. However, despite the ancient castles, sumptuous palaces, and a host of other historic monuments waiting to be discovered, beyond Lisbon lies a wealth of countless day trip options.
So while basking in the ancient glory, following is an index of the best day trips from Lisbon:

	<h5>1.	Sintra</h5>
	<p>Arriving straight out of a storybook, Sintra is one place full of pastel-hued castles and verdant gardens. Considered as one of the most important day trip from Lisbon, it is an incredible blend of a cliff-top castle, along with colourful antique mansions, and Celtic dedications to the moon god, bewitching gardens, and a wide caboodle of history and romance. One of the major attractions in the place is Pena's Palace, a beautiful reminder of the Germany’s Neuschwanstein.
One of the fastest means of transport in the lot would be a cab or self drive, costing you 30-40 mins. Other options include taking a train of 40 minutes or a bus of 1h 15min.

	<h5>2.	Cascais</h5>
	<p>A summertime playground, Cascais has rocketed from a laid-back and sleepy fishing village to a much-loved summertime tourist destination for the travel bugs. Though mainly renowned for its beautiful beach life, its post- beach culture is just as happening, featuring a maze of cobbled lanes leading to quaint museums, beautiful gardens, a rushed marina and a pedestrianised old town dotted with designer boutiques and alfresco fish restaurants. After the sun is set, there are a number of things you can witness in the place with the lively bars constantly fuelling the party.
One of the fastest methods of commutation is a car or cab, taking 40-45 minutes of travel time. Another way to travel from Lisbon to Cascais would be taking a bus, costing you 1h and 30min.
