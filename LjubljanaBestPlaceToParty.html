<h5>2.	Metelkova</h5>
		<p>This one is a self-declared cultural hub for alternative artists. What were earlier military barracks are now replete with underground artists, nightclubs and bars. Friday and Saturday nights are ghastly crowded here, with most clubs hitting the ground around midnight and going on until wee hours in the morning. Slovenian and international DJs, LGBT clubs and insanely cheap booze pulls in large crowds. Visitors call Metelkova a completely different experience, totally unique and alternative from the rest of the town. The looks of this district are kind of eerie, but overall, it is a safe hideout for punters and partiers.
