		<h5>Best Place to Stay in Ljubljana</h5>

		<p>Ljubljana (pronounced Lyoo-blah-nah), the greenest of all European capitals is an ideal escape from the big city bustle. A romantic hilltop castle, a green emerald river with gorgeous footbridges atop, baroque candy-colored spires and cobbled plazas replete with coffee tables- Ljubljana is downright dreamy!
Where to stay in Ljubljana is often the first thing that pops in travelers’ head, since there are no fancy properties or resorts. So here are the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Ljubljana:

		<p>To explore the city thoroughly, the place to stay in Ljubljana is Presernov Square.
