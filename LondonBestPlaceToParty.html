		<h5>Best Places to Party in London</h5>

		<p>London, the capital of cool, is beyond massive to be briefed about with total conviction. Nightlife in London isn’t tough to come by with thousands of pubs and bars sprawling across this world city. From highest of the high end to the most wallet-friendly, bars in London are beyond abundant.

<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	Leicester Square</h5>
		<p>For all the right reasons, Leicester Square is the heart of London’s entertainment district. Nestled in the West End of the city, this busiest crossroad houses the largest multiplexes and most popular Live Theatres. During the late hours, hordes of bacchanals show up to toss back prints at the local pubs. Tourists often complain the area to be overpriced, but you can always join one of their organized pub crawls that run every night. For urban music lovers, Storm plays impeccable music ranging from Hip Hop, R&B, Bashment, Old School Garage, etc. For an offbeat nightout experience, try 99 Club, a place inviting London’s finest comedians and such other talents.

<h5>2.	Camden Town</h5>
		<p>Camden runs an alternative culture in London. Backpackers who take their music way too seriously hit the capital of live gigs. The bohemian feel stretches along the entire Camden Road, with seedy pubs and bars interspersed all over. From classic British pubs to cool, converted bars, there are brands you can’t afford to miss. Begin with Camden Assembly, a corner venue that let Coldplay, The Futureheads and such others play their early London gigs here. Then there is Brewdog, a Scottish Craft Brewery, always packed with beer lovers. Joe’s Bar is another compact bar with not-so-compact fun. Relentless Rock n Roll and Reggae spun by DJs brings everyone to the dance floor!

<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>3.	Shoreditch</h5>
		<p>For grittier and highly bohemian ideas, there are amazing stretches in Shoreditch trolling with bars and pubs. With numerous artists inhabiting the neighborhood, the area has become more and more hipster. From quiet drinkers to hardcore partiers, Shoreditch fills in all kinds of night owls. Fox, an after-work magnet on Thursday and Friday is a little offshore from Shoreditch’s main drag, but loved by locals for its laid-back style. Queen of Hoxton preps an eclectic mix of pub, club and all that’s there, on its enormous rooftop bar. Other joints like the Medicine Bar, Cargo and Catch pull a lot of party crowd too!
