		<h5>Best Place to Stay in London</h5>

		<p>London, Europe’s hippest capital, is a timeless city offering tradition and modernity in one pack! A perfect blend of the old and new, this huge city has evenly spread attractions and activities for visitors.
There isn’t exactly a ‘downtown’ area in London that houses most number of attractions and qualifies to be the best district for accommodation. But based on accessibility, budget-friendliness and popularity, here are the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in London:
</p></div>
<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	West End</h5>
		<p>West end is a loosely marked area close to the Centre of London, dominated by 4 and 5 star hotels. This super expensive place is a haven for deep pockets and offers a lot of fun, with plenteous theatre, nightlife, shopping districts and eateries. From the opulent Mayfair and Piccadilly Circus to the busiest shopping street- Oxford Street, to the insane nightlife district of Leicester Square and Covent Garden- this place charges you exorbitantly for a reason!  Traffic can be tedious here, so prefer not to use your private transport. </p>
</div>
<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>2.	Waterloo</h5>
		<p>If you are a hardcore tourist who wishes to ‘cover’ maximum attractions while taking care of your budget, then base yourself near Big Ben. This considerably central area may not fancy the night owls or shopaholics much, but is a magnet for medium-sized budget travelers who aim to wake up to the sight of London Eye from their hotel window. Tourist attractions like Parliament, County Hall, Aquarium, Westminster Abbey and Trafalgar Square are in close proximity here. Hotel prices drop on and off, so keep a tab on the rates to get the best deals.</p>
</div>
<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>3.	Bloomsbury</h5>
		<p>Closely knit to West End is this rather economical alternative if you wish to be stationed in the heart of London, but while keeping your pocket in mind. Bloomsbury does not boast the most ultra modern aesthetics, but its unconventional bits make a hit with curious travelers. The place is a 15 minute walk to the hippie Covent Garden, a roadstead for party animals. Another truly amazing touristy spot in the vicinity is the British Museum. Besides, there are countless book shops and other remarkable things to explore around this area. It’s a kids’ friendly place offering offbeat attractions like Charles Dickens Museum and Cartoon Museum to keep your little ones engaged. Besides, Bloomsbury has a direct connectivity to Heathrow, so not a bad option for weekend travelers trying to save time.</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
<p>Room rates in London are highly volatile. With the city pulling more business travelers than leisure tourists, prices tend to drop down over the weekends than the working days. So plan a vacation accordingly!</p></div>
