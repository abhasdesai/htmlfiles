	<h5>Best Day trips from Lucerne</h5>


	<p>
    Lucerne, the capital of the canton of Lucerne, and part of the district of the same name, owes its location to the shores of Lake Lucerne. Nestled within the sight of the mounts Pilatus and Rigi in the Swiss Alps, it has long been a Mecca for dedicated wanderlusts. City’s first ever landmark, the epic Chapel Bridge, is a gorgeously quaint wooden marvel that was erected back in the 14th century! With an incredibly advanced, technologically developed and well-run transport network that runs both the trolleybuses in Lucerne and a motor-buses’ network in the city and to neighboring municipalities, Lucerne turns out to be the perfect focal point to branch out for neighboring day trips.
The city nevertheless is a traveler-pleaser, but you might not want to miss what’s around this city. So check out the best day trips from Lucerne to make the most of your vacay:

	<h5>1.	Mount Pilatus</h5>
	<p>One of the most legendary and breathtaking places in Central Switzerland, Mount Pilatus holds a mandatory visit mark in travel bugs’ list. On a clear day, the mountain offers an awe-inspiring panoramic view of 73 Alpine peaks! What makes it further fascinating is the fact that it hosts the steepest railway in the world, along with a spine-tickling tramway and contempo, panoramic soundless gondolas. The views and the environmental aesthetics are sure to blow your mind. You can conveniently find it at an 11 minute ride from Lucerne. There are several bars and cafes at the top, and a terrace to enjoy the views. Also there's a 'Dragon Path' about the myths around this mountain, and several hiking trails to viewing points.
The Pilatus makes an excellent day trip for several reasons. One, its proximity to Lucerne and easy accessibility via two different routes: a cogwheel train from Alpnachstad and a cable car from Kriens, a suburb of Lucerne.

	<h5>7.	BürgenStock</h5>
		<p>A majestic mountain entirely surrounded by the sprawling Lake Lucerne, the summit of Burgenstock offers an extensive bird’s eye view from atop.

The only lagging point is its availability; it runs mid-May - mid-October only!
