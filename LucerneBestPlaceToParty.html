<h5>3.	Europaplatz</h5>
		<p>Brooding beside the main railway station is this starkly newfangled contrast to the medieval character of the rest of Lucerne city. Europaplatz got its facelift in the late 1990â€™s with the construction of a dramatically modern agglomeration of large-scale buildings called the Kultur and Kongress Zentrum (KKL). This glittery showcase for performing arts and corporate conventions reminds travelers of a music box sparkling with acres of glass and metal panels. The auditoriums host some of the best acoustics in the world with a large number of heavy metal, rock and classical concerts holding up.
