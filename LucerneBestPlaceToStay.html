		<h5>1.	Old Town</h5>
		<p>Talk about Zurich, Riga or any such European town, Old Town is usually the focal point of all activity and tourist attractions. In Lucerne, the Old Town is small in area and can be covered maximum in a half day tour. Base yourself anywhere in this district in Lucerne and you can easily access the Lion Monument, the Lake, the Wooden Bridges besides all the main buildings and monuments. If planning a Lake Cruise, then it’s best to stay in this part of Lucerne, since the pier is located right opposite to the main station, which is close proximity to the Old Town. For hikers planning to climb Mt. Pilatus, a mere 10-15 minute ride will get you there. </p>
