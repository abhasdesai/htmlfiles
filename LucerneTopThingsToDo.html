Popular known as: The city of Bridges, Squares and Music, but most of all, the City of lights, legend tells that an angel cast light upon a place and told the anglers to fabricate a chapel in honour for their supporter St. Nicholas. Afterward, the house of prayer turned out to be a piece of the religious community "Luceria", thus the name Lucerne. ------
The first city that joined the Everlasting League of the 'three forest cantons' in 1332, Lucerne is located an hour away from Basel and offers outstanding mountain views, a scenic medieval quarter and lake cruises. The tourism capital of the country is located on the edge of Lake Lucerne and was a regular halt on the 'Grand Tour' route of Europe in the past, serving visitors like Goethe, Mark Twain and Queen Victoria.

Past the Lucerne lake are the mountains, snow-secured lasting through the year, commanded by the immeasurably great pinnacle of Mount Pilatus. And also an exceptionally all around well-maintained Old Town, there are sunny old squares, charming temples, a unimaginably beautiful wooden extension, wide lake-side promenades, and at the city's heart the startling dark seriousness of the Culture and Congress Center, which gives a sharp differentiation to the interesting quality all around. The city is stuffed with history, because of its key position as a passage between Protestant Northern Europe and Catholic Italy.
