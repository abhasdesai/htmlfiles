		<h5>Best Day trips from Moscow</h5>

		<p>To describe Moscow, one can use a lot of paradoxical dead ringers such as uncomfortable and charming, filthy rich and desperately poor, fast-paced and lethargic, trendy and kitschy- and a lot more all at the same time. The image that the world's largest capital draws up must be something majestic and impressive, since the place boasts a great historical value, and each nook and corner that you plan to visit will inculcate the fact deeper within. While experiencing the artistry, history and sublimity all within the boundaries, convincing your-self to leave the place might turn hard.
However for the complete Russian experience, here are some of the best day trips you can plan from Moscow:
