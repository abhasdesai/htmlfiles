<h5>2.	Glockenbachviertel</h5>
		<p>Glockenbachviertel is a nightlife area in Munich alternate to Schwabing, that hosts many first-rate discos and bars. It is the meat of Isarvorstadt, a precinct located south-east of Munich’s Old Town. This neighborhood is more liberal, younger and eccentric than the traditional district of Schwabing. Small boutiques and cute little cafes draw a lot of hip crowd in the daylight, while the umpteen nightclubs don’t let you sleep early at night. A number of street parties and festivals are held in this locality, like the epic Sommerfest and the popular gay parade Hans-Sachs-Strasse Schwules Strassenfest. The area together with the beautiful Gartnerplatz hosts most of Munich’s gay scene.
