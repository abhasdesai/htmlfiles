		<h5>Best Place to Stay in Munich</h5>

		<p>Munich, the eve upholding Bavarian metropolis is Germany’s unofficial southern capital for all the right reasons. Millions of boozers gather in this Mitteleuropa capital city during Oktoberfest to toast the town.  A magnet for power dressers and art aficionados, Munich is known for its Mediterranean cafes and highbrow art.
So if you have Munich city on your Euro Bucket list, here are the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Munich:
</p></div>
<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	Altstadt</h5>
		<p>Like every cliché European district, Altstadt is a maze of cobbled alleys, soaring churches and medieval squares. All the main streets lead to the neo-gothic Town Hall at Marientplatz. The buzzing Victualienmarkt food bazaar is where all the locals shop. Then there is the extravagant Residenz Palace and twin towered Frauenkirche for tourists. To hit the main train station of Hofbrauhaus, go west. This postcard-perfect neighborhood of Munich hosts some of the most opulent fashion stores, eateries and hotels. Naturally, finding an accommodation in Altstadt can be a bit bank breaking. </p>

<h5>2.	Maxvorstadt</h5>
		<p>Maxvorstadt is the cultural polestar of Munich. Stationed to the north of Altstadt, this 19th century district begins from the Odeonsplatz Square. Besides, it is home to Ludwig Maximilian University, Olympic Park, BMW World Museum and the famous boulevards of Leopoldstrasse. For historians, Kunstareal Museum Quarter is a show stealer, exhibiting works of Rembrandt and Magritte in its twin Pinakothek galleries. Go north and you land up in Schwabing, the area replete with artists, students and young aspirants hanging out in pavement cafes, bookshops and boutiques. </p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>3.	Lehel</h5>
		<p>Lehel, a magnificent 19th century district boasting quirky narrow lanes and century old consulates lies to the east of the City Center. Go north to explore the Englishcher Garten Park, with River Isar flowing to the west of Lehel. The world-famous tourist attraction like the artifact-packed Bavarian National Museum, Archeological collection and the State Museum of Ethnology- all lay in the neighborhood of Lehel. In close proximity to this district are the restored Art Nouveau Villas and the renowned Messe Munich Trade Fair. Lehel is a fairly priced, relatively serene neighborhood with all the action at a stone’s throw distance. On weekends, landlocked Germans head on to the south of the English Garden, ready to surf on a permanent manmade break in the Eisbach River.</p>
