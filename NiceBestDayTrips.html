<h5>2.	Saint-Paul de Vence</h5>
<p>
  Majestically perched on a hill overlooking the Provence countryside, Saint-Paul de Vence is a typical ancient village near Nice. The town retaining its medieval charms offers you a peek-a-boo into the well-preserved circle of 16th-century ramparts.  Having been built in the 14th century in the Romanesque style highlighted by the Baroque Chapel of Saint Clement, the Collegiate Church is a must visit place. The beauty of the town can be best experienced by wandering in the narrow cobblestone streets that wind through the village, witnessing plenteous delightful fountains, pleasant squares, and colourful art galleries.
Just a 30 minute car ride away, the best way to travel is drive on the beautiful road up to Saint Paul de Vence. For non drivers, there are main public buses running to and fro, taking 45 minutes to 1 hour.

<h5>3.	Eze</h5>
		<p>Another typical Euro medieval village, Eze is the epitome of "village perché" clinging to the edge of a steep conical rock. Known as "nid d'aigle" by the locals (meaning eagle's nest), this village has a very dramatic location lying about 427 meters above the Mediterranean Sea. Home to some of the most beautiful sights of sunsets and sunrises, Eze has the cultural integrity in the form of Church Belfry and the ruins of the ancient fortress visible from a great distance. However, the best way to experience the village is by taking a stroll through the charming cobblestone streets and alleyways that exhibit cute little boutiques and small courtyards.
There are three ways to get from Nice to Eze; a car ride taking about 30 minutes and buses taking around 40 minutes. But the best and most offbeat way is by hiring a bike that would take an hour and a half but provide you with a breath of fresh air.

Replete with beautiful natural setting of pine groves and sea views, along with 16th-century ramparts clustering around the old town of narrow cobbled streets, Antibes boasts an interesting cultural heritage. Walking around the medieval downtown is easy and fun, but you can also rent a bike to get an easier access to the hilly neighbourhoods.
