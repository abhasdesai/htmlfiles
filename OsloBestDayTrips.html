<h5>3.	Drobak Christmas Town</h5>
		<p>To the East of Oslo Fjord lies this picturesque ancient neighborhood of Drobak. It is one of those travel-back-in-time towns with a maze of 18th century cobbled streets and small wooden houses. The Father Christmas Post Office (with the special Santa Claus Stamp) and Tregarrden Christmas House give it that perfect, Christmas Town setting, the one you seek at the North Pole. Just outside of Drobsk, over a tiny atoll, is the Oscarsborg Fortress, which can be reached with a 5minute ferry from Sjotorget.
    During summers, you can take a ferry from Oslo to reach Drobak. Other than that, regular buses run from Oslo to Drobak city center, which take half an hour to reach your destination.

<h5>4.	Bærums Verk</h5>
		<p>With over 50 shops, handicraft workshops, art galleries, restros and cafes, this cute little place is sure to take your heart away! Earlier known for the ironworks, this refurbished shopping village gets set to party on Saturday nights, when a plethora of activities like live music, kids’ entertainment and markets play their schedules. Try an open fire sweet treat in one of its Dutch-inspired Pancake Houses; it is an absolute delight especially in the winter time.
