		<h5>Best Places To Party in Oslo</h5>

		<p>Oslo isn’t really up for grabs for social drinkers, thanks to Norway’s stringent alcohol policies and regulations. But despite the bank-breaking hootch scene, it has a lively nightlife scene that hosts live jazz, local cuisines and fancy, experimental cocktails.
After the locals are done with the infamous ‘Vorspiel’ (pre-parties at home) with their gang, they hit the clubs for further ado. Low-key and laid-back party scene pulls in mostly the smarty-pants kinds. So stow your sports shoes for a while and clean up a little to hit the top places to party in Oslo:

<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	Karl Johans Gate</h5>
		<p>Located in the main touristy spot of Oslo, the main street of City Centre hosts Karl Johan’s gate. This neighborhood hosts a wide variety of bars and pubs to crawl all night. Since it’s the core of the city, entry and alcohol here could leave a hole in your pocket. There’s FLAIR and NOISE at Hard Rock Hotel to shake some fancy booty. Other than that, try Friday’s Bar- a baby of TGIF group.
</p></div>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>2.	 Torggata</h5>
		<p>A fairly short street reserved for pedestrians and bicycle riders, Torggata hosts many world-famous bars and eateries. Its ideal location between Grunerlokka and Youngstorget made it beyond worthwhile for party animals. Hit TILT and CAFÉ SARA to party and booze. For concert aficionados, there’s Rockefeller and John Dee holding some really popular music shows. </p>

Then there’s Sudoest, a crazy bar scene that pulls locals and tourists alike. For two left feet that need a dance floor to show some talent, the backyard-turned-club Kaos is up and running!
