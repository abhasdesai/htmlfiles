		<h5>Best Place to Stay in Paris</h5>

		<p> Paris- the City of Lights, turns out to be a vacation of a lifetime for many travelers. Although its infamously garish reputation of being unaffordable breaks many vacaying hearts, but if you play your cards right, you can explore Paris at its best while keeping your pocket safe.
Paris is divided into 20 Arrondissements (Neighborhoods), with the lowest number being closer to the center of the city. Here are the Top 3 Arrondissements for accommodation for a tourist in Paris:
</p></div>
<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	The Marais (3rd-4th Arrondissement)</h5>
		<p>Marais is a wonderful, art-filled, centrally-located district with several attractions in close proximity like Pompidou, Musee Picasso and Hotel de Ville. Other main spots such as The Louvre are at a walking distance as well. This extremely safe area is gay friendly and hosts medieval architecture. The famous Jewish Quarter houses excellent shops, restaurants and cafes. A nighttime entertainer for the locals, Marais serves a perfect shopping experience for the hippie fashionistas. Stroll on rue Charlot on a Sunday to enjoy the unpretentious art galleries restaurants and wineries. Night scene is quite intense with all the major action going on in this vicinity.</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>2.	9th Arrondissement</h5>
		<p>The 9th one isn’t really big on attractions, but it’s truly Parisian to the core. It is mostly a residential zone that has The Opera and Galleries-Lafayette Departmental Store on one side and the edge of Montmarte on the other. Despite being so closely positioned to Central Paris, it is ghastly under-crowded, which is a great thing for peace seekers. A lot of great cafes and eateries rest in this locality, with Moulin Rouge, Palais Garnier and a bunch of strip joints being at a walking distance. All in all, it’s a great base for tourists who wish be close to the main attractions by away from the city bustle.</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>3.	Belleville (19th-20th Arrondissement)</h5>
		<p>If you are done with all those cliché touristy places and seek a more hipster vibe now, try Belleville. Home to a bunch of varied communities, it is the gentrified area of the French capital. For gourmands, it is absolute heaven, thanks to its wide selection of ethnic food catering mostly to African and Middle Eastern cuisines. Museum of Science and Industry rests in this area along with Buttes-Chaumont, a great place to take your kids. Hotels and hostels are fairly prices if you are traveling on budget.</p>
</div>
<div class="container content-wrapper">
<p>A few words of wisdom- Keep some distance from the Eiffel Tower and Champs-Elysees areas while choosing an accommodation. They are worth exploring but definitely not worth staying. Besides the city metro is extremely efficient to connect you to all that’s there to unravel.</p></div>
