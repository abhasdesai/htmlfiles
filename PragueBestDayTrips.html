		<h5>Best Day trips from Prague</h5>

		<p>Prague, the largest city in the Czech Republic and also the former capital of Bohemia, was once Europe’s most beautiful and romantic cities. Even today, the city manages to boast an enchanting riverside and a skyline dotted with hundreds of golden spires shimmering in the sun. Having largely avoided the architectural purge of the Cold War, the city’s medieval Old Town looks much as it did a thousand years ago. It is somewhat still evident through the cobblestone streets winding across spacious city squares.
While it is indeed tempting and intriguing to spend an entire holiday exploring Prague’s architectural, musical and culinary delights, these listed best day trips from Prague offer the curious travelers a few rewarding experiences as well:

<h5>1.	Krivoklat Castle</h5>
<p>
  Burned down to dust a number of times but constantly rebuilt with pride and hard work, Krivoklat Castle has finally manages to turn the tables in its favor and begun to function well. Today, the castle works as a historic museum, tourist spot and a place for theatrical exhibitions. Collections of weapons, Gothic paintings and books are stored there. Perched on top of a forested hill, Krivoklat was built as a residence for the royals during the 13th century. Its isolated location has helped to preserve the castle’s Gothic interiors, which are filled with paintings, art and more than 50 thousand volumes of books. Once also served as a house for political prisoners, visitors have felt the eerie presence of some unusual reminders of its darker past. Surprisingly, even the carvings in the Royal Chapel depict angels bearing instruments of torture.
One hour away from Prague, you can visit Krivoklat Castle via day excursion buses, public buses and private taxis. You can also travel by train, but will have to switch trains on the way at Beroun, taking a total travel time of 2 hours 15 minutes. Taxis on the contrary, take hardly an hour but leave a hole in your pocket.

<h5>2.	Castle Karlstejn</h5>
<p>
  This castle is a large and most frequently visited Gothic castle founded 1348 CE
by Charles IV and the King of Bohemia. Located about 30 kilometers south-west of Prague, Karlstejn castle is an easy day trip from this main city, which makes it a convenient and popular attraction for tourists and locals alike. A short and beautiful trek up to the hilltop fortress offers mesmerizing views of towers and turrets as well as the pretty town at the bottom.
