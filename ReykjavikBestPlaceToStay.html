		<h5>Best Place to Stay in Reykjavik</h5>

		<p>Reykjavik, a quaint small town clung to the corner of a largely uninhabited island, is as beautiful as the people living in it. Experiencing a tourism boom off late, the Icelandic capital has upgraded a lot in terms of accommodation and facilities.
So if you are wondering where to stay in Reykjavik, here is a list of the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in the city:
</p>
</div>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	Midborg</h5>
		<p>Icelanders have a habit of identifying neighborhoods with their postal codes, and 101 stands for the downtown, or Midborg. People seeking a stay in the heart of the city and in close proximity to the main touristy spots should base themselves here. Downtown Reykjavik is vibrant and vivacious with a lot of cafes, eateries, brand stores, museum and galleries keeping it tied up. But all this comes with a price; it’s hard to locate a pocket-friendly hotel in this area. Visit the Hallgrimskirkja Church, the Harpa Conference Hall and the lovely Tjornin (City Lake). Weekends in this neighborhood are often loud and boisterous, thanks to the raving Reykjavik nightlife concentrated mostly around Laugavedur, downtown’s main street.</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>2.	Laugardalur</h5>
		<p>The eastern end of the city is all about cafes, restaurants and recreational activities. Laugardalur has a multi-faced personality with residences and businesses flourishing exponentially in a locality that has dedicated geo-thermal pools. It may not be as hip as the downtown, but a slew of family-themed attractions makes it a hit among group travelers. Take your little ones to the Reykjavik Zoo, Botanical Gardens and Laugardalsvallur Stadium. The hot pool complexes offer a perfect haven after a long day of foot-exploration of this tiny atoll. It rests on one end of Laugavedur, the hustling main street of Reykjavik; so you are stationed in close proximity to a lot of action!
    </p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>3.	Vesturbaer</h5>
		<p>To the west of the city centre is a rather quiet and vastly upscale neighborhood of Vesturbaer. The area has sea on both sides, which makes it a lot more picturesque than other localities. Major tourists aren’t much around here; National Museum of Iceland and the University of Iceland campus are on the eastern edge, while the Marine Museum is on the northern fringe. Vesturbaejarlaug, Reykjavik’s most famous geo-thermal pool lies in this area. Connectivity by buses is limited, so it’s better to walk to the main area. Rent a bike and you will reach downtown within 10-15 minutes!</p>

<p>Reykjavik is one of the safest cities of the world. So you don’t need to worry about basing away from the main area or strolling in the streets during late hours. </p></div>
