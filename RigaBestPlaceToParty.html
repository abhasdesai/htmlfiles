		<h5>1.	Old Town</h5>
		<p>The Old Town in Riga is a geographically and historically significant area of the Latvian capital. The whole neighborhood is built with cobblestone alleys and architectural gems. The 72 m high St. Peter’s Church Tower lets you take a bird’s eye view of the entire district. Some of the best bars and clubs in this area are set in old factories, former warehouses and music schools. Night hubs of every sort, ranging from sports club to sophisticated cocktail lounges, to retro haunts- Riga does it all! For small, local gigs and a crazy hip night, try I LOVE YOU. Then there is Orange Bar, a girls-only staff bar for young hearts right in the center of the Old Town. For a typical British Pub ambience serving Beer and Whiskey, try Dickens Pub. Casablanca, Roxy and Depo are other popular night clubs in this neighborhood.
