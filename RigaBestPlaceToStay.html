<h5>2.	Berge Bazaar</h5>
		<p>Bergs Bazaar, a historical village-like pedestrian enclave, is the most charming shopping and dining destination of Riga. Casual and upbeat, this area is flocked by locals and tourists. Located between the Marijas and Elizabetes Streets, this area has been established as a center of commercial and recreational activity. After you are done with the tourist attractions of Riga (which are closely stationed to Bergs Bazaar), spend your evening people-watching in this district. Many low-key bars and pub can be accessed in this neighborhood as well. Being a car-free zone works in its favor as the whole aura of Bergs is quite, serene and romantic, especially after dark when the lights beautify the whole area.

<h5>3.	Mezaparks</h5>
		<p>If you are not a first timer to the Latvian capital and seek a weekend getaway in Riga, then nothing serves better than the forest park and suburb of Mezaparks. To the north of the Old Town, a 40 minute ride takes you to the outskirts of Riga, where Mezaparks rests in wild nature, a zoo and many recreational activities. It is adjacent to the lake and forest, and mostly consists of summer cottages, villas and private houses.
