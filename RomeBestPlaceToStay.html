		<h5>Best Place to Stay in Rome</h5>

		<p>For over two millennia, Rome has been a mecca for travelers and historians. Even today, it continues to be as exhilarating as it was centuries back. Enthralling history, exquisite Italian cuisine and an excellent selection of designer boutiques, Rome is every type of traveler’s dream.
With a towering tourism industry, it is hard to decide which the best place to stay in Rome is. But depending upon your purpose of travel, you can always pick from the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Rome:
</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	Centro Storico</h5>
		<p>The historic center of Rome, now restored and more beautiful than ever- Centro Storico encompasses the legendary Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona, The Spanish Steps and the Panthoen. For first time visitors, it is the perfect place to base yourself. However, the prices can be aptly bank-breaking. So if you don’t mind splurging on accommodation and food in Rome, try Centro! You can pick one of the Twilight City Strolls that shows you the most breathtaking vistas of the Roman city. The Trevi is beyond magnificent at night; you would love to step out of the hotel room right into the Piazza.</p>

<h5>2.	Jewish Ghetto</h5>
		<p> This intriguing testament to history is tucked in the heart of the city, adjacent to Centro Storico. Crooked streets, cobbled alleys and a lovely old-town feel makes this district quaintly European. Popular attractions like the Jewish Colosseum, Campo de Fiori and Piazza Farnese can be accessed in the blink of an eye. The Great Synagogue and Bocca della Verita can bite your hand off if you lie! If you have a penchant for food, wish to be centrally located but away from the tourist bustle and seek an authentic Roman experience, Jewish Ghetto is the ideal place to stay in Rome.

<h5>3.	Celio</h5>
		<p>With The Colosseum dominating the heart of this neighborhood, Celio stands out to be a quiet residential district in Rome. Home to the most amazing leftovers of history- The Colosseum, The Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum, Celio lets you have a great time-travel  experience. In broad daylight, this area could be quite chaotic and noisy, but after dark, you will be thrilled to see the magnificent amphitheater in its full bloom. Options to stay in Celio are limited, so you need to book well in advance to engulf in the suburb Roman feel. If you are already done with the main squares and wish to explore the ancient Roman ruins, Celio is the best place to stay in Rome.</p>
