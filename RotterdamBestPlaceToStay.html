		<h5>Best Place to Stay in Rotterdam</h5>

		<p>Unlike other Dutch cities, Rotterdam is all modern architecture. After the World War II wrath, the city lost its quaint medieval charm and got a facelift like the one of New York or Shanghai. The largest port city of Europe and one of the most urbane cities of the continent, Rotterdam pulls in millions of visitors every year.
Depending upon the location, prices and views, here are the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Rotterdam:

<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	Delfshaven</h5>
		<p>The only neighborhood in Rotterdam that qualifies for a historic town is Delfshaven. A glaring contrast to the other districts in the city, here you will find some original old buildings, an ancient brewery, an actual Wind Mill, and some of the cliché European alleys and narrow walkways. Famous landmarks like Oude of Pelgrimvaderskerk, Hett Witte Huis, the Photographic Museum and Natural History Museum are stationed in Delfshaven. Then there are a lot of shops, cafes, restaurants and everything else you need to enjoy your vacation. This district in Rotterdam is ideal for those who seek ancient, European charm even while traveling across avant-garde cities.</p>

<h5>2.	Central District</h5>
		<p> Home to giant international companies, upscale restaurants, fancy shopping malls and cute little cafes and shops, Central District is the soul of Rotterdam. The unusual, futuristic architecture is best displayed in the Central District, like the Cubic Houses near the Blaak Underground station and the whimsical monuments near the Central Station of Rotterdam. If you choose to stay here, you will be right in the heart of the city, in close proximity to all the main tourist attractions of Rotterdam around. Visit Sint-Laurenskerk and the Town Hall while you are in Central District.

<h5>3.	Riverside District</h5>
		<p>Noordereiland is connected to the Central District via the Willembrug Bridge. The area’s Old Railway Bridge De Haf is the main tourist attraction of this neighborhood. Located close to the Northern Island is the Riverside District (not an official name of the district but more of a geographical location). Oude Haven, a popular tourist area rests in this neighborhood. Central District borders this area, with the Cubic Houses and Maas embankment sandwiched between the two. Here you will also find the legendary Maritime Museum founded by Prince Henry. Enjoy magnificent vistas of Rotterdam from the Observation Tower Euromast.</p>
