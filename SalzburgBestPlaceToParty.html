		<h5>Best Day Trips from Salzburg</h5>

		<p>Salzburg may not be geographically mondo, but its ‘University Town’ characteristic coupled with its musical and cultural excellence makes the city a decent venue for night owls. Irish pubs and inns, live music venues and small, cozy bars may not qualify as “exciting” according to the international clubbing standards, but Salzburg serves well to the low-key, easy-going clientele.
    So check out the top 3 place to party in Salzburg:
</p></div>
<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	Alstadt</h5>
		<p>Alstadt, a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site, is a gorgeous ensemble of medieval spires and fairy-tale like aura. Despite the stringent rules in this area (so as to save the ancient-ness), Altstadt accommodates a peppy nightlife in Salzburg. Besides being a hub for daytime sightseeing and shopping, Altstadt offers the best nightlife in Salzburg. Talk about laid-back pubs and bars, or minutely-pretentious nightclubs and discos, everything rests here. Café Altstadt in Radisson Blu is fairly eye-catching for people seeking a sophisticated space over food and drinks.

<h5>2.	Rudolfskai</h5>
		<p>Go left of the Salzach River and you land up in Rudolfskai, Salzburg’s top party mile exhibiting some well preserves parts of the city walls. This heavily fortified face of Salzburg now has most of its monuments between Staatsbrucke and Mozartsteg converted into Irish pubs and swanky bars. On weekends, it is the most favored spot for youths to get high and wasted. Nightclubs in Rudolfskai are generally loud and noisy in character. Try the Shamrock Irish pub for good booze. O’Malley’s and Aperitivo are other popular joints that are mostly packed to capacity.</p>
</div>
<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>3.	Steingasse</h5>
		<p>This one is a beautiful, compact medieval neighborhood sandwiched between the foothills near Kapuzinerberg and the Salzach River. Away from the bustling city traffic, Steingasse is actually quite near to the main heart of the city. Pass the inner Steingasse Gate to access the various bars, art cinemas like DAS Kino, boutique stores and bookshops. Fridrich, a cute little bar in the narrow Steingasse street hosts and extensive selection of popular Austrian wines while you relax after a hectic day listening to the gamut from Tarantino to jazz to Italian music. This area doesn’t host any grand nightclub, just some self-contained, quaint joints for nocturnal fun. Besides, some of Salzburg’s infamous brothels also reside in this district.
