		<h5>Best Place to Stay in Salzburg</h5>

		<p>Those who know music know Salzburg. Recitals drift out of the main-street churches and classical music pours out of every downside street window in Salzburg. This extremely picturesque Austrian town is right out of a fairytale; a massive fortress nestled in lush green mountains on all sides, with cobblestone alleyways, brightly colored spires and a splendid river flowing through.
So if you are planning a vacay to this magnificent European city, base yourself in one of t he top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Salzburg:
</p><br>
<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	Mulln</h5>
		<p>Northern face of Altstadt is what they call Mulln (Mill), a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the smallest sub-section of Altstadt boasting a country-side feel to tourists. Mullner Stadtpfarrkirche is the most popular touristy spots in this neighborhood. Mullner Brau is a popular Beer garden, the biggest in Austria, drawing thousands of beer lovers every year. Adventurers love to base themselves here in Mulln, thanks to the Monchsberg mountain right behind the church of the monastery. Hike up to the top to get some spectacular vistas of Salzburg. </p><br>
</div>
<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>2.	Neustadt</h5>
		<p>This one stands tall on the site that was previously city walls and bastions. The term means New City, an alternate construction to Altstadt, The Old Town of Salzburg. Running parallel to the Linzergasse Lane, Naustadt houses many historical monuments along the Salzach River. It is merely a 10 minute walk to the city center, where all the main tourist attractions hail. It is a most preferred alternative to the old town, for there are fewer tourists and most serenity. </p><br>
</div>
<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>3.	Morzg</h5>
		<p>Those who donâ€™t care much about the expenses and are willing to splurge on fancy neighborhoods can pick Morzg. It is a tiny district in the south of Salzburg and known to be the most exclusive area in the city. Stationed closely to the Zoo of Salzburg and the Leisure Palace of Hellbrunn, its busy and commercial segment called Alpenstrabe is well known to shopaholics. The hidden historical gems are unknown to most travelers and even to locals. The area is a mix of agricultural land and posh population. As for accommodations, you can avail both first-rate hotel chains to budgeted 2 star properties.</p><br>
</div>
<p>It is advisable to stay away from the main train station of Salzburg. Despite the well-established connectivity to all major districts in Salzburg, this area is way too noisy and jammed. But overall, nothing can alter the divine beauty of this land. Salzburg is a true European gem.</p>
