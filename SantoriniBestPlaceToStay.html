		<h5>Best Place to Stay in Santorini</h5>

		<p>The most daunting decision while planning any visit is the choice of accommodation. To choose between the beaches situated along the eastern coast of the island and the towns located on the western edge of the island, perched on the caldera cliff in Santorini can easily be an ordeal. Is there an organised way to do this at all?
To help you choose between the luxurious caldera towns and the relaxed budget friendly beach towns while seeking a place to your liking is the duty we have taken upon ourselves. Here is a rundown of the best neighbourhoods in the vicinity to find a place to stay during the visit. So to plan before the visit, read on the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Santorini:
</p></div>
<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	Fira</h5>
		<p>The largest town on the island, Fira is one of the most picturesque spots in the entirety of Greece. Along with the blessing of an enchanting view, Fira is also the epicentre of many restaurants, antiquity and colloquial shops as well as hotels providing the perfect place for accommodation in Santorini. If you are also looking for nightlife in your vacation, Fira plays the epicentre of the nightclubs in Santorini. However, if your definition includes peace and solitude as an integral part, then it might not serve as the best choice. </p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>2.	Imerovigli</h5>
		<p>Located on the higher end of the hill, this place is known for its phenomenal sights of the sunsets. One of the quietest towns in Santorini, this place is one that inspires inspiration. Though not a very big attraction on the restaurant front, but the ones in the vicinity are all in the strata from good to great. The proximity to Fira and Firostefani also solves the other requirements of human indulgence. So if you want to take a step back from humanity and enjoy nature, this is the perfect place to live.</p>
</div>
<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>3.	Oia</h5>
		<p>Home to some of the best hotels in Santorini, Oia is counted as the most romantic town in the vicinity. Replete with captivating sunsets and a bustling neighbourhood in Santorini, this is said to be the best stay for your honeymoon. The restaurants in the area also top the lists of Santorini, though the nightlife of the place lacks some color and vibe. The walk from Oia to Fira is enthralling but is a bit long and people generally prefer to drive instead. That being said, this is one of the most sought after locations by couples visiting the place.</p>
