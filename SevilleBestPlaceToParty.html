		<h5>Best Day Trips from Seville</h5>

		<p>
      Alongside the horse-drawn carriages and gothic cathedrals in this medieval city of Spain, you will now find gimmicky boutiques, pioneering tapas and 17th-century palaces converted into newfangled hotels. Owing to the temperature here, the city is naturally nocturnal. You'll come across endless temptations as you walk down the narrow, flower-bedecked streets of Seville.
These top three places at Seville are brimming with hotels and rooftop bars that offer entertainment for the makings of a full night out in their small-hours breezes with creative cocktails and stunning views:

		<h5>1.  Alfalfa</h5>
		<p>If you’re looking for a hip, upscale vibe that’s still beautiful, historical and central, Alfalfa is the place for you. Nocturnal activity in the core of the city center starts with the area around Plaza Alfalfa. There are various spots where you can find something on almost any night of the week. To name a few, el Cabo Loco, Sopa de Ganso and Berlin, which stay open until the early morning hours.

<h5>2.	El Arenal</h5>
		<p>Once home to the ship building yards and now a paramount contemporary district in Seville, El Arenal is an upscale neighborhood with posh spots and cocktail bars. Despite the modish touch, it is still very convenient and a great option for both budget and luxury travel. The famed bullring, La Maestranza, and an opera house, Teatro de la Maestranza are located here. The locality is packed with bull-themed restaurants and posh cocktail bars. From the famous Irish bar, Flaherty’s to the aesthetic Antiguedades, there are several bars along Calle Adriano and the surrounding streets.</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>3.	La Macarena and La Alameda</h5>
		<p>Despite the historical pomp, these are two popular destinations for nightlife in Seville. If you head into these less touristy areas of the town, you'll find broad, tree-lined avenues circumscribed by lots of bars, gastro pubs, live music venues, avant-garde cafes with outdoor terraces, dance clubs, and a lively punk and boho-hipster scene. Nearby is Calle Feria, just east of the Alameda. Here you’ll find a gastronomic market that hosts weekend concerts.
