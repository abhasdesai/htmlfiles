<h5>2.	Poljud</h5>
		<p>
      The area behind Poljud Stadium comes to life mainly after 1am, when everyone else is fast asleep except the real party animals. A 20 minute walk or a 5 minute Taxi ride from the Old Town gets you here, where Croatians and travelers get along for dance and booze. Vanilla Club, a place packed to capacity almost all the time in summers, offers a huge terrace to find a corner somewhere and people-watch. Hemingway Bar, another crowd-pleasing nightspot in Split is perched right next to the Azure Sea.

<h5>3.	Bacvice Beach</h5>
		<p>
      Bacvice is a complex of bars, restaurants and cafes to let you spend the entire evening and night here. This area is up and running in the late hours, since most of the Old Town in Split switches off lights around 11-12pm. Neighborhood to the left end of Bacvice beach turns into a Party Mile with all the buildings switching their avatar of a great nigh out. Audience here is mostly young and super energetic. Tropic Club, the most popular one here, turns the radar high after midnight. Oâ€™Hara Nightclub and Pub located right next to the beach between Zenta and Firule has two storey banging with music of all varieties.
