<h5>1.	Medjugorje</h5>
<p>
  Those on a spiritual sojourn to Croatia will definitely have this one high up their charts! Medjugorje is more of a pilgrimage for Catholics and all those who believe in Virgin Mary, after the town’s kids sought to have encountered her back in 1981. Visit the St. James Church or climb up the Apparition Hill to experience the long maintained mysticism. Other than that, the village hosts a peaceful charm for spiritual renewal and growth.
Medjugorje is a 3 hour bus ride away from Split. A car drive would get you there in much shorter time. Don’t forget to carry your passports, as you will be crossing the borders from Croatia to Bosnia & Herzegovina.

<h5>2.	Hvar</h5>
<p>
  Gorgeous beaches, clear skies and romantic sunsets replete with swanky hotels and elegant restaurants serving gourmet seafood and a vibrant nightlife- so much for one little isle! The sunniest spot in the country offers an extra dose of luxury, just a few miles away from Split. Get set to rub shoulders with affluent yachties and countless youth partiers in the beach area. For a subdued and low-key day off, try Stari Grad and Jelsa. Then, as you unravel the interiors of the city, you will encounter the most gorgeous vineyards, lavender fields and craggy peaks.
Take a 2 hour ferry ride from Split harbour to reach Stari Grad; then another half an hour ride to the island of Hvar. The luxury travellers can rent a catamaran too.

		<p>
      Perched with pride on the Dalmatian coast is the bewitching port town of Bol, an attractive old town built up of small stone houses and streets dotted with pink and purple geraniums.
