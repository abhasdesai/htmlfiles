		<h5>Best Day trips from St. Petersburg</h5>

		<p>A city harbouring revolutionary spirit, the sheer grandeur and history of Russia's imperial capital never ceases to amaze the witnesses! Initially intended to play an exhibit to show the imperial Russia's growing status to the world today, St Petersburg still feels every bit of the imperial city with its historic heart largely frozen in time. Known as the Venice of the North, this place has a wide network of elegant canals crossing 342 bridges. Be it history or art, St. Petersburg is one city that pioneers in sobriety, possessing almost unrivalled treasure trove of art and culture.
Finding yourself amidst the grandeur, leaving the city grounds would be the last thought on your mind. However, the true spirit of a traveller will urge you to explore beyond the boundaries of St. Petersburg. To curb that itch, here are some of the best day trips from St. Petersburg:

Acting as the living proof of the extravagance of Russia's Imperial rulers, Pushkin can easily outshine the city of Versailles in terms of grandiosity and excess. The 18th century saw the construction of two vast and extremely spectacular palaces both circled by extensive manicured gardens and beautifully decorated architecture. The Catherine Palace built for Empress Elizabeth is truly one thing awing people for over two centuries.
Located at a meagre distance of 27kms the fastest mode of transport will be the train taking less than half an hour. Other options include bus taking 1 hour and cars approximately half an hour.

<p>
  Embracing the Gulf of Finland, Peterhof is another town inheriting the stateliness earning it the title of 'Russian Versailles'. Remnants of Peter's strategies and constructions during the World War II, Peterhof suffered the worst damage a nation could think of.

Recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, this reconstructed glory is one you would not want to miss.
Located at a distance of 49 kms, one of the fastest and most beautiful ways of travelling is to catch a ferry from St. Petersburg, taking you 30 minutes to reach Petergof. Other options include bus taking about an hour and cars taking quarter of an hour of road time.
