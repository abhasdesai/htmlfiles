		<h5>1.	Dorsoduro</h5>
		<p>For Dorsoduro, the status of incorporating maximum academic institutions goes parallel with having the craziest nightlife in Venice. A heavy number of bars and nightclubs dominate this district to cater to the intellectual population here, mainly confining to the areas of Zattere, Accademia and Campo Santa Margherita. Café Rosso and Orange are most popular spots in Il Campo, which packs to capacity right from evening until late hours. Piccolo Mondo, a prime dancing venue since late 1960’s has its base near the Accademia gallery.
