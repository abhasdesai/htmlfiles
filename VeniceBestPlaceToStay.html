		<h5>Best Place to Stay in Venice</h5>

		<p>Venice, the ideal honeymoon destination for all the love-struck cupids, is gloriously romantic for all the right reasons. With hundreds of canals and bridges and centuries old palaces, Venice turns out to be a fairly rewarding city to all the travelers. To experience a memorable interlude to Venice, simply get lost in its winding streets and cobbled alleys. A Bellini here, a Vivarini there, Venice is way beyond the Rialto and Gondolas.
Finding the best place to stay in Venice is no breeze, especially if you are traveling on a budget. So when deciding where to stay in Venice, try one of the top 3 places for accommodation for a tourist in Venice:
</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
		<h5>1.	San Marco</h5>
		<p>Choosing to stay in San Marco or not, your travel itinerary will definitely get you here at least once a day. This small sestiere is not so small on the price charts, thanks to its pandora’s box of Venice’s main tourist spots. The Basilica, St. Mark’s Square, Harry’s Bar, Rialto Bridge and the Doge’s Palace- all lie in this district in Venice. If luxury is your proverbial cup of tea, look no further than this fully action-packed neighborhood. Designer shops, upscale cafes, fancy crowds and loads of hustle-bustle, San Marco is the king of tourist attractions in Italy!</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>2.	Dorsoduro</h5>
		<p>Calm and quiet in the daytime, and ear-splitting loud after dark, Dorsoduro is where you should stay in Venice if you want to escape the touristy hubbub but still be close enough to all the major spots. Choose to stay south of Campo Santa Margherita and you will witness Venice like a local. Venice’s most famed art gallery the Academia lies in this vicinity, with the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, the San Sebastiano Church and the Giudecca Island being other major spots.</p>

<div class="container content-wrapper">
<h5>3.	Cannaregio</h5>
		<p>A beautifully authentic neighborhood in Venice and home to the greatest Jewish Ghetto quarters, the Santa Lucia train station and a large number of Venice’s native residents, Cannaregio hosts the most amazing Hanukkah celebrations across Europe. Main tourist attractions like the palace of Ca d’Oro, the Church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli and the works of the famed painter Tintoretto. If you wish to discover Venice off the beaten path and away from the touristy crowds, then this area would be a plus plus; it’s inherently cheap and would let you experience the core of Venice. For travelers having Burano and Murano on their itinerary, Cannaregio is a perfect place to stay in Venice, thanks to its close proximity to the port.</p>
