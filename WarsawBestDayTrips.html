Along with this, the place will also provide you the opportunity for your culinary needs keeping it light on your wallet.
Along with the bewildering past, for the complete Poland experience here are the best day trips from Warsaw:

<h5>1.	Kraków</h5>
<p>
  Aptly considered a diamond in the rough, Kraków is a place with a mythical atmosphere rushing through veins. According to the fables, the city was founded on the defeat of a dragon, which convincingly permeates through its attractive streets and squares. The old town is brimming with some of the most impressive churches and museums along with Rynek Główny, the largest market square in Europe. Besides the culturally beautiful sites, there is a wide array of restaurants bars and clubs you will enjoy. Aside from the history and nightlife, try a simple stroll through the Old Town and you will be awed by the harmony of the quiet back street, the humble nature of the architecture and the light. This harmonious blend of past and present is one that shouldn't be missed.
Located at almost 300 kms distance from Warsaw, the best option to travel is the train, taking a total rail time of 2h 30mins. Other options include bus 4h 45min and driving the way taking a little less than 4 hours.

<h5>2.	Gdańsk</h5>

  Another one of the unique towns in Poland, Gdańsk blessed with centuries of maritime ebb, is full of distinctively un-Polish architecture.

<h5>3.  Lublin</h5>
		<p>A hotbed of culture, Lublin is the largest city in the south-eastern part of Poland.
